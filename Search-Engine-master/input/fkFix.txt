00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.647
Sorry Jeff, I just started
recording. You might Oh no

3f23cba5-e6b4-4896-bfda-14b921f7870b-1
00:00:06.647 --> 00:00:08.730
worries. So I just copied the.

9ba86d31-d36f-41d6-ad9f-d31287ff912f-0
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.675
I went to this Hatter typed in
U.S. central EAP, figured out

9ba86d31-d36f-41d6-ad9f-d31287ff912f-1
00:00:14.675 --> 00:00:20.071
primary replica and environment.
So now I'm going to grab this

9ba86d31-d36f-41d6-ad9f-d31287ff912f-2
00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:23.070
value is in the third one
primary.

e9b7ea80-8b59-4fa6-a119-1c671697ffd1-0
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.223
So this is the environment. OK,
this is the individual machines

e9b7ea80-8b59-4fa6-a119-1c671697ffd1-1
00:00:29.223 --> 00:00:32.170
so OK yeah, so now I'm gonna go
here.

45112efc-8996-4dec-87c9-cd230a5090f8-0
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.316
Type this in. Yeah, just type
that into the filter. I double

45112efc-8996-4dec-87c9-cd230a5090f8-1
00:00:37.316 --> 00:00:40.420
click this and now we see a list
of our machines.

df6f40e1-95e7-4ece-a682-8a79be0f1b95-0
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.480
And if we look back here, it's
the one that ends in 553.

954030fd-e04d-47a9-a316-c21cf959bf03-0
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.621
That's gonna be this guy right
here, so I'm going to right

954030fd-e04d-47a9-a316-c21cf959bf03-1
00:00:50.621 --> 00:00:50.930
click.

e0e4e70b-b9c5-4e4f-b166-93f136d5bb98-0
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.750
Request admin access.

978dd2b8-fcbe-4265-9f50-ce591c6d6857-0
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.530
And we're going to go.

da352930-e462-4a44-92b5-cadd8ff3ca08-0
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.530
Live site issue.

7d736575-c7f2-4582-b47e-afb0f2176c30-0
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.590
And request access. So now you
should have a JIT request.

093e34b5-337f-4b01-bca0-8b31ddaa21e5-0
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.610
Coming your way that you could
approve, OK?

07975d2d-c035-472a-aff2-3538fc8b8688-0
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.677
And are you doing this from your
saw? Yes, OK, so from that no

07975d2d-c035-472a-aff2-3538fc8b8688-1
00:01:20.677 --> 00:01:24.026
one machine I can't do that.
Yeah yeah yeah we have to do

07975d2d-c035-472a-aff2-3538fc8b8688-2
00:01:24.026 --> 00:01:25.470
this from the saw always.

72bb224b-9e34-431f-a981-7309814597a7-0
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.620
I'm yet to request for saw.

211127c9-cd4a-4997-8cf5-6f64303c96bb-0
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.680
Ohh

6f86f438-3dcf-43ca-ac42-a3591b1bfca9-0
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.742
like I did some stuff, uh, do
you not have a saw? Not yet. I

6f86f438-3dcf-43ca-ac42-a3591b1bfca9-1
00:01:43.742 --> 00:01:48.992
requested for us silo and then I
am yet to request for UB key and

6f86f438-3dcf-43ca-ac42-a3591b1bfca9-2
00:01:48.992 --> 00:01:49.470
stuff.

bfd9c3df-7941-4c23-9a25-02c5d54ff4f9-0
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.140
OK, cool.

17c32052-2272-4e5f-9947-56883d8565c3-0
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.340
OK, looks like I have to do it
like.

cde868fe-28a9-4498-ae5c-3c3e5af068ad-0
00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.820
Esap sorting.

13215520-685d-4d37-9a23-58072977fc31-0
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.410
Yeah, I just added you both in a
single chat OK.

22d595c5-04fa-49e4-b92a-7c2a2480444a-0
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.970
OK, so for to approve GIT. That
also needs stop.

744e0b84-176f-45d0-b6a9-6e4c9cc33d7e-0
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.970
Yeah, it has to be on a saw so.

6217856a-a2c8-41f2-b21f-2e0684b363ba-0
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.980
Or maybe Joseph can.

4eab0c79-8609-4512-bf67-0ed403e82de3-0
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:40.020


b2bbb8b1-71c7-4cd8-8db3-dd8bacdbf708-0
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.460
Well, it looks like somebody got
it awesome so now.

5796e6db-009d-4643-b087-c043ff0bf56f-0
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.435
OK, so we need to wait at that
same screen until someone

5796e6db-009d-4643-b087-c043ff0bf56f-1
00:03:37.435 --> 00:03:41.566
approves it. Yeah, so somebody
approved it. Yeah, so that's

5796e6db-009d-4643-b087-c043ff0bf56f-2
00:03:41.566 --> 00:03:45.423
that's kind of standard
operating procedure, so there's

5796e6db-009d-4643-b087-c043ff0bf56f-3
00:03:45.423 --> 00:03:47.420
that DSMS core team stand up.

48fe5bb1-dec2-4883-8925-8f577e243b04-0
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.410
Usually somebody will see it in
there.

ca66b27e-88f1-4986-8717-b4c17d161e66-0
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.660
Yeah, there are always messages
JIT please yeah.

414658bf-93cc-4baf-ae12-48402b04a794-0
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.228
So now I'm just clicking on the
Windows button. I type SSMS and

414658bf-93cc-4baf-ae12-48402b04a794-1
00:04:00.228 --> 00:04:02.140
that will bring up management
studio.

72977aad-082e-48d9-9348-359f92ea4fe1-0
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.010
So we're pretty confident that
there's not going to be.

7212f637-13d7-4c1f-868e-03be748f6489-0
00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.960
Substantial changes to this, so
even if.

9b0dc8ce-f529-4c93-a344-b9b6a97b99c8-0
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.250
Like what ends up running.

32a2897c-1e6c-4fa7-a386-037ed2fc5511-0
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.291
Later on, it's just going to be
the go statement, so if you make

32a2897c-1e6c-4fa7-a386-037ed2fc5511-1
00:04:28.291 --> 00:04:30.060
any other changes to this
script.

178bf640-e171-47ee-a318-53a4d9010548-0
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.612
Just if you could make a note
that U.S. central EU AP is kind

178bf640-e171-47ee-a318-53a4d9010548-1
00:04:36.612 --> 00:04:37.160
of in.

d2d1dbc5-c568-4350-b983-72f2513bab1f-0
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.990
Rogue mode.

038cdd1a-47d2-4d8f-9f00-172e33b12d2d-0
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.970
You know, because you know we
did a one off script here. What

038cdd1a-47d2-4d8f-9f00-172e33b12d2d-1
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.140
we're trying to avoid is.

a48f26e3-5363-4d39-85bb-95e6e170f302-0
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.460
Umm?

34f6e604-f780-4269-af10-3f3f1b12a979-0
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.417
You know, snowflake service. You
know, we want. We want all of

34f6e604-f780-4269-af10-3f3f1b12a979-1
00:04:54.417 --> 00:04:57.485
our database servers to to look
the way they do because all of

34f6e604-f780-4269-af10-3f3f1b12a979-2
00:04:57.485 --> 00:05:00.455
the same scripts ran everywhere,
right? And so we're kind of

34f6e604-f780-4269-af10-3f3f1b12a979-3
00:05:00.455 --> 00:05:03.280
breaking that right now.
Sometimes you got to do it, but.

8215002b-2808-4eb0-91d8-e53760042b3a-0
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.096
This this should be the
exception and not the rule and

8215002b-2808-4eb0-91d8-e53760042b3a-1
00:05:08.096 --> 00:05:11.832
we should get back to the
everybody's the same state

8215002b-2808-4eb0-91d8-e53760042b3a-2
00:05:11.832 --> 00:05:12.890
really fast so.

e9368d78-717d-44eb-8245-82576ecfd56d-0
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.427
This was so so when it was the
one that you picked up from

e9368d78-717d-44eb-8245-82576ecfd56d-1
00:05:17.427 --> 00:05:17.730
that.

ec3943ce-37ad-43e3-b917-b93c135d69d9-0
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.143
Geneva website exactly exactly.
So now I'm going to go DSB

ec3943ce-37ad-43e3-b917-b93c135d69d9-1
00:05:23.143 --> 00:05:27.508
synchronized so I can tell it's
synchronized because I can tell

ec3943ce-37ad-43e3-b917-b93c135d69d9-2
00:05:27.508 --> 00:05:31.600
our primary because it's gonna
say synchronized by click on

ec3943ce-37ad-43e3-b917-b93c135d69d9-3
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.510
always on high availability.

f504237a-233e-452a-90a4-f2e7a07fd8d6-0
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.906
Right click and say show
dashboard. We can see the always

f504237a-233e-452a-90a4-f2e7a07fd8d6-1
00:05:39.906 --> 00:05:43.379
on availability group and all
the other machines that are part

f504237a-233e-452a-90a4-f2e7a07fd8d6-2
00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:43.710
of it.

2fc0b596-eda8-455c-abf8-492079938c0d-0
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.213
We don't need that for what
we're doing right now, but this

2fc0b596-eda8-455c-abf8-492079938c0d-1
00:05:50.213 --> 00:05:53.541
is just something you'll do a
lot during your life sites,

2fc0b596-eda8-455c-abf8-492079938c0d-2
00:05:53.541 --> 00:05:57.156
because there's always some some
machine or database who's not

2fc0b596-eda8-455c-abf8-492079938c0d-3
00:05:57.156 --> 00:05:57.960
happy with us.

ad11a8de-0c3e-4e9b-8194-b61cde7c2856-0
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.940
So I'm gonna say new query.

fe84fbd0-993d-47e8-a65e-c27df751c000-0
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.859
Gonna pop back out to here. This
is our guy so I'm going to go

fe84fbd0-993d-47e8-a65e-c27df751c000-1
00:06:11.859 --> 00:06:13.040
select all copy.

12bbf406-84f6-456f-af10-a29a4bb85b50-0
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.360
Taste, so now I just want to
take a look at this.

42aee351-f831-435e-bc18-8e6f51ebba04-0
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.560
OK, I think we have extra go
here, but.

f2755af1-9fe5-43e5-be9a-d9101b43234f-0
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.590
But it's alright I guess after
the first if statement.

e4ceb5e8-48ef-4a58-b758-247050403698-0
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.190
Yeah, that's fine.

387afe06-7ec2-4f6b-addd-8f9a2cf1f6c9-0
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.101
And you tested this and
everything, right? Yes, yes, I

387afe06-7ec2-4f6b-addd-8f9a2cf1f6c9-1
00:06:50.101 --> 00:06:52.300
did OK. So what could go wrong?

2e7b8d75-1fc3-4fd6-9c6b-056c2f029d8d-0
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.470
Alright, so now.

974038f8-de5b-420f-87d7-827b2b01eaac-0
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:03.238
So if any, could you make a note
that that we did a one off thing

974038f8-de5b-420f-87d7-827b2b01eaac-1
00:07:03.238 --> 00:07:04.580
in U.S. central EAP?

83086b07-2ec0-4ea2-9620-b77bb1ad2bad-0
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:08.670
Just you know, after like.

89218948-b3ff-4871-98c8-9aff45f8cc71-0
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:14.084
This script goes into master. We
just want to make sure that this

89218948-b3ff-4871-98c8-9aff45f8cc71-1
00:07:14.084 --> 00:07:15.710
guy becomes consistent.

47d10a7a-7b72-4832-b954-c9d534304d84-0
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.640
And it probably will be, but I'm
just being paranoid.

4a284d6c-8c7d-4c8a-afd7-8badd6fcf783-0
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:22.850
Yeah, I'll make a note.

862a88ec-7063-441e-aea4-6800a3c433fd-0
00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:27.680
And I know, so I just if you
have a couple of more minutes,

862a88ec-7063-441e-aea4-6800a3c433fd-1
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.010
Jeff.

84e684d4-e249-4d44-b624-fe57a768b131-0
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.479
First, I think you sent me an
e-mail about adding the work

84e684d4-e249-4d44-b624-fe57a768b131-1
00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:37.535
items, like adding, adding an
item, saying that we might need

84e684d4-e249-4d44-b624-fe57a768b131-2
00:07:37.535 --> 00:07:40.609
to uncomment that unit test that
we commented.

ce2413ff-1092-409d-9f3b-6f1f1cbd5547-0
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.038
Right, but I but I don't have
that. I don't have access to

ce2413ff-1092-409d-9f3b-6f1f1cbd5547-1
00:07:45.038 --> 00:07:46.400
those work items or queries.

77fa777e-63db-47d7-abd3-b8e8e573a95a-0
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.440
So I don't know how to do that.

a10a8575-5e48-4559-845a-bd2c55d9353c-0
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.773
OK, so I don't. I'm gonna see I
may not be able to do that

a10a8575-5e48-4559-845a-bd2c55d9353c-1
00:07:55.773 --> 00:07:57.010
either right now.

99cf583a-faf4-4c75-b167-d7101e8940c4-0
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.971
But I I keep making the notes
and I'll update once I get the

99cf583a-faf4-4c75-b167-d7101e8940c4-1
00:08:01.971 --> 00:08:04.280
access. Yeah, so let's see here
to do.

d6a42562-638a-43be-a591-5ce23e0f2a1d-0
00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:13.284
I I can give the desktop machine
and I can't get to my desktop

d6a42562-638a-43be-a591-5ce23e0f2a1d-1
00:08:13.284 --> 00:08:14.600
machine right now.

d74d6de2-18ba-4650-bd2a-2ef1d731a927-0
00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:16.370
Yes, Sir.

7f9d525b-935b-43a5-8892-89de435acd53-0
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.740
I just OK can can you access
this link from yourself?

c3900786-a619-4e0a-be3b-d062153b2536-0
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:23.620
Let's see here that book.

91a52782-6754-4f92-a0f4-1659ea3be2c8-0
00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:43.490
OK, cool so I'm gonna add this
as a favorite.

465d4f50-75a1-4097-ae59-2abbdf19be9e-0
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.640
Is there a way you can add me
here?

3bd09a93-b05f-4329-b2a6-42693c83b1de-0
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.020
Oh, you don't have access. I see
what you're saying, yeah?

cf904750-db07-4cd5-be6e-bb5cb905557b-0
00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:53.210
This thing.

2229fdc4-e131-4849-9e45-535f7264e23f-0
00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.980
For this specific you know query
I can actually like. I can see a

2229fdc4-e131-4849-9e45-535f7264e23f-1
00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.440
bunch of items but not this one.

6d007cf5-bcc8-4d5e-a2ed-992222d1a700-0
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.280
This 18217 feature.

1bd603be-627f-48d7-9aa5-8ecc6c4fa3ab-0
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:03.930
That that.

7dbca015-000f-4fbf-989d-670f31c10347-0
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.390
I wonder if it's just because
it's a.

89d905b2-7513-43af-85f8-47d3a92e345b-0
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:27.240
Is it because it's in my area?
So like if I save this to?

d8b879ed-9d49-41e0-a5d2-7f44659744f0-0
00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:01.580
Yeah, I can see these folders as
well.

811882ad-2759-49b5-9a01-0fc92ae67f5e-0
00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:09.760
So if I put it in.

7e0b0e95-f690-4a1d-83bf-f070e804f778-0
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:49.800


74344f69-9b0e-48bb-9a1d-84e3aea3316a-0
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:55.743
OK, do you still have that open?
Can you paste the link in chat?

74344f69-9b0e-48bb-9a1d-84e3aea3316a-1
00:10:55.743 --> 00:11:00.201
Oh nuts, I didn't. OK no
problem. I can get there. I can

74344f69-9b0e-48bb-9a1d-84e3aea3316a-2
00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:02.470
either so I'll click on this.

1fe5912a-68da-4041-a52f-2e6e543d9fb2-0
00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:07.095
And then I'll take me to what
you sent me to. And then I'm

1fe5912a-68da-4041-a52f-2e6e543d9fb2-1
00:11:07.095 --> 00:11:08.440
gonna go to queries.

5a357160-228a-4d0b-bc2f-3a04fd9bbf0b-0
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.710
My favorites, which is in shared
queries.

c2f7f195-c586-43e5-920c-34334f61b846-0
00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.240
Secret management

604e93af-9261-4da2-a837-d8bdb48554f6-0
00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:20.330
and then I'll give that back to
you.

ddaf60c5-812b-4f94-8db7-da6b6b304e3d-0
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.560
So can you access that?

47734be8-3ea6-43c1-a480-c634f0afe7fb-0
00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:32.210
Yes.

746e7889-5aba-437d-9fe8-48dfe2ab75cf-0
00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:36.958
Alright, so I'll add two work
items here, one for that unit

746e7889-5aba-437d-9fe8-48dfe2ab75cf-1
00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.920
test and the one that we did
today, awesome.

532c5999-b8c6-4d2f-829c-fd9c5067000f-0
00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:44.840
Yeah, and so the way we
typically do things is is we do.

ae111edd-3855-4476-9967-be54e2f7b8b8-0
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:50.190
Is it one month sprints? I think
we do one month sprints now.

7e2b4372-475b-43c1-8751-5bb917f18daf-0
00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:55.706
And so we'll do this this
trophy. It will be a feature and

7e2b4372-475b-43c1-8751-5bb917f18daf-1
00:11:55.706 --> 00:12:00.050
this will typically span
multiple months. But like we'll

7e2b4372-475b-43c1-8751-5bb917f18daf-2
00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:04.317
be something that we try and
deliver within a semester.

7e2b4372-475b-43c1-8751-5bb917f18daf-3
00:12:04.317 --> 00:12:08.890
Although we usually take a
little bit longer. And then what

7e2b4372-475b-43c1-8751-5bb917f18daf-4
00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:13.767
we put in these product backlogs
are things that we're going to

7e2b4372-475b-43c1-8751-5bb917f18daf-5
00:12:13.767 --> 00:12:15.520
try and fit in a month.

d0d5db02-3c04-4bbb-a5a0-bf79c5d37ccb-0
00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:20.360
And then that's going to be what
Srinivas tracks and what he

d0d5db02-3c04-4bbb-a5a0-bf79c5d37ccb-1
00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:23.514
takes to like his management
meetings where he talks about

d0d5db02-3c04-4bbb-a5a0-bf79c5d37ccb-2
00:12:23.514 --> 00:12:26.935
what the team completed. So try
and organize your work that way

d0d5db02-3c04-4bbb-a5a0-bf79c5d37ccb-3
00:12:26.935 --> 00:12:30.142
and then anything that you put
inside. Like you know all of

d0d5db02-3c04-4bbb-a5a0-bf79c5d37ccb-4
00:12:30.142 --> 00:12:33.402
these things that I did here.
These work items and tasks and

d0d5db02-3c04-4bbb-a5a0-bf79c5d37ccb-5
00:12:33.402 --> 00:12:33.670
such.

a15c2d84-602f-45e2-be52-bf7655c79dac-0
00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:38.305
Uh, that's just whatever helps
you to track your own work,

a15c2d84-602f-45e2-be52-bf7655c79dac-1
00:12:38.305 --> 00:12:42.431
right? Right? Shrinivas is only
gonna look at like this level of

a15c2d84-602f-45e2-be52-bf7655c79dac-2
00:12:42.431 --> 00:12:43.130
visibility.

3968f087-f727-4d5a-bf8a-6bc5b3ae101e-0
00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:48.434
So but yeah, as long as you make
sure that everything you create

3968f087-f727-4d5a-bf8a-6bc5b3ae101e-1
00:12:48.434 --> 00:12:51.846
is hanging off of this feature,
it's not gonna get lost. So you

3968f087-f727-4d5a-bf8a-6bc5b3ae101e-2
00:12:51.846 --> 00:12:55.257
know we we can clean things up
later. Just just, you know, make

3968f087-f727-4d5a-bf8a-6bc5b3ae101e-3
00:12:55.257 --> 00:12:56.910
sure it gets tracked somewhere.

084e1f55-e344-496a-ad9b-f98efe4dc40b-0
00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:01.359
Right, like it makes sense to me
just to create a like. OK so

084e1f55-e344-496a-ad9b-f98efe4dc40b-1
00:13:01.359 --> 00:13:04.980
first parent is feature then we
have product something right

084e1f55-e344-496a-ad9b-f98efe4dc40b-2
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:05.930
product space B.

042fc3ed-7471-4c66-9a84-d7475e01830d-0
00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:11.233
That's that's all nested inside
feature right? And then further

042fc3ed-7471-4c66-9a84-d7475e01830d-1
00:13:11.233 --> 00:13:13.680
we have task right and then also
bugs.

dfaa361f-e46b-486a-88ac-4ca194396837-0
00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:19.640
OK, are these guys down here?
They they exist at the same

dfaa361f-e46b-486a-88ac-4ca194396837-1
00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:24.002
level as a product backlog and
so I kind of go back and forth

dfaa361f-e46b-486a-88ac-4ca194396837-2
00:13:24.002 --> 00:13:28.435
between tracking things as bugs
and tracking them as tasks off

dfaa361f-e46b-486a-88ac-4ca194396837-3
00:13:28.435 --> 00:13:32.867
of here so you know it kind of
depends on the size of the bug,

dfaa361f-e46b-486a-88ac-4ca194396837-4
00:13:32.867 --> 00:13:33.290
right?

cd97ce6d-13ef-4229-970d-a131228b8305-0
00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:39.386
Right, so yeah, it's you know
it's something that's going to

cd97ce6d-13ef-4229-970d-a131228b8305-1
00:13:39.386 --> 00:13:39.700
take.

fa2a0c15-1745-49a2-8751-142d40f9bfe9-0
00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.400
Along time to fix, you know you
can go ahead and.

26610dec-3f62-4791-9908-dea0e17b2bd9-0
00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:48.697
Just track it as a bug so, but
yeah, because those two things

26610dec-3f62-4791-9908-dea0e17b2bd9-1
00:13:48.697 --> 00:13:52.160
are like clean up. Think things
right once we have.

3dad72bf-96ec-4310-86bd-0911f3f9a5fa-0
00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.990
OK yeah yeah.

3c37558d-c25b-492f-82a6-44764011dd73-0
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:57.880
OK, probably I'll just create a
bug then.

ee3f4b59-079b-4092-9003-11d0790f941b-0
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.500


955560ef-7aba-4727-88a6-7b0e0aded29b-0
00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:06.890
Sounds good.

05614e78-3d93-4582-9a54-0c9c7bd5ea84-0
00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:18.690
Jeff, you there? Yeah, I'm here.

e1d756fc-2699-4b7d-984d-5d4e6cee744c-0
00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:24.519
OK, so does it make sense to
create a bug for both of those

e1d756fc-2699-4b7d-984d-5d4e6cee744c-1
00:14:24.519 --> 00:14:25.620
items, I boy.

bc544b69-edfd-4713-8b30-efe982cfaf3f-0
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:30.612
Alright, I could just create a
folder saying clean up and add.

bc544b69-edfd-4713-8b30-efe982cfaf3f-1
00:14:30.612 --> 00:14:32.610
Yeah you know, I mean if
there's.

95e5b032-2cc8-4ab5-8369-ae475a393fb5-0
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:38.505
Yeah, I'm not sure how to do
that because I don't you know

95e5b032-2cc8-4ab5-8369-ae475a393fb5-1
00:14:38.505 --> 00:14:42.221
like the the bug thing can get
really unmanageable, you know.

95e5b032-2cc8-4ab5-8369-ae475a393fb5-2
00:14:42.221 --> 00:14:45.877
And if we have so many tasks
that we're just spending all of

95e5b032-2cc8-4ab5-8369-ae475a393fb5-3
00:14:45.877 --> 00:14:49.233
our time clicking around on a
website that gets kind of

95e5b032-2cc8-4ab5-8369-ae475a393fb5-4
00:14:49.233 --> 00:14:51.930
annoying to yeah, so maybe what
we wanna do.

9ad4a31d-4f4f-4726-be43-1eefdebafc83-0
00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.279
You know what I would do is just
create them as tasks hanging off

9ad4a31d-4f4f-4726-be43-1eefdebafc83-1
00:15:01.279 --> 00:15:03.320
of this last bug here on the
bottom.

b9d7cff0-8319-4bfb-bf79-1dc7e34dcb8b-0
00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:04.540
OK.

c4ccbe2d-3594-44a1-93c1-ced1a2aa3b63-0
00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:06.520
I think that's probably.

16ff9178-5eee-4a1b-ba8d-3170cf90d0b3-0
00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:10.872
You know and then and then the
bug's not done until you know

16ff9178-5eee-4a1b-ba8d-3170cf90d0b3-1
00:15:10.872 --> 00:15:12.510
all of those subtasks are done.

488085b4-c955-40bd-9bcd-9651891e257f-0
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:17.385
OK, yeah sounds good. Can we do?
Can we do that by like inside

488085b4-c955-40bd-9bcd-9651891e257f-1
00:15:17.385 --> 00:15:20.951
your ****? Can we create task?
OK yeah so like you can just go

488085b4-c955-40bd-9bcd-9651891e257f-2
00:15:20.951 --> 00:15:22.310
here you can open it up.

b641a36f-08f2-4791-8191-db456701ccdd-0
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:26.780
Or you're actually. Here's what
I. I'll click here and I'll say.

0d9061cb-691f-4b3a-9b22-8346745ec11c-0
00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:32.674
Create new links where I linked
to a new work item. OK yeah and

0d9061cb-691f-4b3a-9b22-8346745ec11c-1
00:15:32.674 --> 00:15:33.800
then say child.

6cc495d1-1bbf-4db3-9b7a-9898c409c89f-0
00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:37.080
Task.

b4109934-58f3-4fb4-8c46-f9b6b58efd1c-0
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:41.060
Blah blah blah.

a9d4a93c-dc8a-4ced-9697-ee10e983cd02-0
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.600
And one last thing.

bb24e50e-3029-4b4c-93dd-0f3652c9f2c5-0
00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.645
I had something in mind, but I
just forgot. OK, yeah, so I'm

bb24e50e-3029-4b4c-93dd-0f3652c9f2c5-1
00:15:50.645 --> 00:15:54.114
saying I, I'll just make these
go changes whatever you said and

bb24e50e-3029-4b4c-93dd-0f3652c9f2c5-2
00:15:54.114 --> 00:15:57.582
I'll test it real quick and I'm
gonna raise the PR again if you

bb24e50e-3029-4b4c-93dd-0f3652c9f2c5-3
00:15:57.582 --> 00:16:00.779
get a chance please approve it.
Then I'm going to merge it

bb24e50e-3029-4b4c-93dd-0f3652c9f2c5-4
00:16:00.779 --> 00:16:01.430
