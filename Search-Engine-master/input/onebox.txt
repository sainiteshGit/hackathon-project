90928788-4c3e-45f3-807a-c3edc09acd6b-0
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.650
So in in the artifact you you
map like the UM.

7cb57eab-5461-421c-bd43-f63daaf8e513-0
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.480
The the bills.

15d81d11-ba9a-47fa-998c-05ecab0a376c-0
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.580
Pipelined, we want the latest
version of specific version

15d81d11-ba9a-47fa-998c-05ecab0a376c-1
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.220
right and then the other weird
thing is we've got this source

15d81d11-ba9a-47fa-998c-05ecab0a376c-2
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.670
alias.

f72b87cf-293d-4970-b4de-b1634e08b2ef-0
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.386
And it needs to map up match up
with the value. If we go into

f72b87cf-293d-4970-b4de-b1634e08b2ef-1
00:00:27.386 --> 00:00:27.830
tasks.

ae33fbbb-67c2-41c3-887d-5840f2fe3716-0
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.050
Select that first task it needs
to match with.

4ed929c9-a038-4ba4-b3e5-64d8fe850764-0
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.440
This value here.

cdee6274-52f8-40a1-b54f-d5a1a693c2d4-0
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.295
Ohh which it looks like it
already does and then what you

cdee6274-52f8-40a1-b54f-d5a1a693c2d4-1
00:00:43.295 --> 00:00:47.070
do is you is you say this and
then it's all.

f279f941-f9fb-4f25-b2c1-25f0f232700f-0
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.490
Goodness. So it looks like this
is already.

b7e9abfb-ee02-4ba2-97b6-63b65b3bdfec-0
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.552
The primary artifact because if
we look at one of these other

b7e9abfb-ee02-4ba2-97b6-63b65b3bdfec-1
00:00:55.552 --> 00:00:56.040
artifacts.

6ea06a49-b537-4c43-8e55-b816a7fc6cea-0
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.635
We have an option to market as
primary. So right now it looks

6ea06a49-b537-4c43-8e55-b816a7fc6cea-1
00:01:00.635 --> 00:01:03.866
like it's pointed at master, but
as pointed at a specific version

6ea06a49-b537-4c43-8e55-b816a7fc6cea-2
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:06.853
so we could point it at the
version that Scott your stuff in

6ea06a49-b537-4c43-8e55-b816a7fc6cea-3
00:01:06.853 --> 00:01:07.000
it.

b755be88-9735-4b95-953a-cf8a2104e0fa-0
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.040
And and then go.

cf5eb5b9-1f06-4a49-8d3e-e1cf36b5043e-0
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.838
Can we just the latest and it
will pick up the latest green

cf5eb5b9-1f06-4a49-8d3e-e1cf36b5043e-1
00:01:14.838 --> 00:01:19.237
bid? Right? Exactly. Except that
the latest build is a garbage

cf5eb5b9-1f06-4a49-8d3e-e1cf36b5043e-2
00:01:19.237 --> 00:01:21.960
build. OK. And the way I know
that is.

8daf1fa2-8698-40ca-a46d-a6a113fea4e5-0
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.830
Looking at Red Dog builds
branches.

e4be9d2c-9b8f-472f-8546-da56d801e54c-0
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.170
UM.

fc575613-dff5-4830-b5cc-c9b36942ade7-0
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.540
The most recent build would be
this guy.

2d7feb5a-ad4d-47ed-959b-5d440710499e-0
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.320
And we don't even have like a
retail AMD 64.

8930bc0b-e498-42c1-80b1-ebca4ce7d549-0
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.830
Like, who knows? I don't know
what happened on this thing.

f46bad75-3b5b-47ce-a67e-001ed99664c9-0
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.700
OK, so it may not be deployable.

4662b292-e3a5-4c7e-9505-0a7868ed6aa5-0
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.520
So so how do you know the second
last is also not deployed?

5e293deb-77a5-4c88-b366-69d6ede10075-0
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.955
I I just I checked that folder
as well. So it it was also

5e293deb-77a5-4c88-b366-69d6ede10075-1
00:01:58.955 --> 00:02:01.390
lacking those debug retail. OK.

bc70224a-c278-40ac-b546-4e20d30505b9-0
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.540
So, uh, I can tell these are
garbage.

877f07e7-0dbf-4b15-a957-1c2d0ece788f-0
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.229
OK, looks like on the 9th we
maybe got a good one and so that

877f07e7-0dbf-4b15-a957-1c2d0ece788f-1
00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:13.190
was 328-5060.

71e8563f-9f26-47b1-a1a7-4446b1e2a460-0
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.790
OK. So that's what we are
pointing to.

4d5ce9f1-8410-4116-801d-fee71299e945-0
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.920
328.

e70b774b-51ca-4324-b495-efeae8b0e672-0
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:22.960
56 oh.

6c07c013-4175-45cf-98b4-ab93b2fece8c-0
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.520
So we could actually go specific
version.

1f62ec99-cee9-44a2-814b-4e36c6be0a9f-0
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.830
OK, so according to them like
this.

19230f24-c544-406f-91ce-59c8dbe82ab8-0
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.990
It looks like it only does good
builds. Yeah. Say latest. Yeah.

0ddda3d8-a798-463f-96b5-c0aa3accbe20-0
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.930
So uh.

36af0654-1805-4050-99e0-5b27a438abff-0
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.595
The question is whoever last
updated this sounds like

36af0654-1805-4050-99e0-5b27a438abff-1
00:02:44.595 --> 00:02:48.410
somebody was doing something
really specific in here.

8492cece-41ea-4b15-b934-a38f692dbb18-0
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.690
So that's why I was trying to
get.

4b3dcdfa-bcb3-4cd1-8f56-57cec5905e66-0
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.100
Something from Danny.

8fc7d037-5114-42b9-b7dd-7f4deaf9d0eb-0
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.160
And no answer. So yeah, I'm not
sure.

33e78ebe-8c06-4448-a2dd-824464124525-0
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.893
And then, UM, we're kind of low
on developer environments right

33e78ebe-8c06-4448-a2dd-824464124525-1
00:03:06.893 --> 00:03:10.652
now that that's kind of our our
problem, right. So we've got

33e78ebe-8c06-4448-a2dd-824464124525-2
00:03:10.652 --> 00:03:14.287
developer two, which we're all
kind of sharing, so whoever

33e78ebe-8c06-4448-a2dd-824464124525-3
00:03:14.287 --> 00:03:18.108
needs it the most gets it. And
that's been Danny for the past

33e78ebe-8c06-4448-a2dd-824464124525-4
00:03:18.108 --> 00:03:21.743
few weeks because he's working
on some Fiji stuff and then

33e78ebe-8c06-4448-a2dd-824464124525-5
00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:24.640
we've got developer one, which
is reserved by.

5d2b0a48-02a7-4fb5-aa0a-41f6ef83b543-0
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.160
The Australia team for testing
the trigger service.

3ec122fc-ae3f-4e3e-9146-46051a22db3d-0
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.550
Ohh or no?

5306c0ab-440b-4ff0-ad88-cdfd40d1ba6c-0
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.900
By well, by by by the SDP's team
and we got developer 4 which is

5306c0ab-440b-4ff0-ad88-cdfd40d1ba6c-1
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.220
Australia team developer three.
Somebody else.

d4f80d75-d518-49b3-b324-f308f4005a40-0
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.490
Has UM.

8c816bb9-aa38-497e-94e1-730471686380-0
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.220
Hmm, so you know typically what
we'll do is we'll just send out

8c816bb9-aa38-497e-94e1-730471686380-1
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.450
a an e-mail to the team and go,
hey, is it OK if I test on this?

ba416dee-bde3-4ffd-994e-a198343b7ef9-0
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.491
OK, so but you didn't didn't
send out any e-mail, right?

ba416dee-bde3-4ffd-994e-a198343b7ef9-1
00:03:58.491 --> 00:04:03.855
Yeah. Can I test on developer
two and then so just send that

ba416dee-bde3-4ffd-994e-a198343b7ef9-2
00:04:03.855 --> 00:04:05.790
out to DSMS fte's and.

099f6c41-61a1-4f5e-bf83-0171564697cb-0
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.759
Go from there and then we. But
we do need to find out from

099f6c41-61a1-4f5e-bf83-0171564697cb-1
00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:13.200
Danny what the status of the
master build is.

8cbc1a08-ca37-45d8-ae30-fed04fd979b2-0
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:16.230
Hmm.

0d842f4e-fb8a-4383-a02d-e01dfac7a3ab-0
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.754
Ohh the other thing I wanted to
send you was the wiki article

0d842f4e-fb8a-4383-a02d-e01dfac7a3ab-1
00:04:25.754 --> 00:04:30.599
about how all this works and so
I'm looking in the DSMS Azure

0d842f4e-fb8a-4383-a02d-e01dfac7a3ab-2
00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:30.990
wiki.

41159fd7-7373-4c82-9c5f-662eda83e1df-0
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.390
I'll send you that this is kind
of our internal documentation.

92dc8a36-71a9-41d0-bb60-557f67226d2b-0
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.236
That we use and inside of there
we've got this developer tips

92dc8a36-71a9-41d0-bb60-557f67226d2b-1
00:04:41.236 --> 00:04:42.000
and tricks.

4616178b-dadb-4afd-88fa-c3827957f87f-0
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.880
So that's one good place to go.

753b4074-7d95-4803-a1ab-54b14383016f-0
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.222
Lot of neat stuff in there. And
then there's also this bit on

753b4074-7d95-4803-a1ab-54b14383016f-1
00:04:51.222 --> 00:04:52.540
deployment and release.

241a880c-4e0e-4ceb-bd0c-e1e9365459f7-0
00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.360
And there should be something.

c09f32ea-c188-46a0-aa7e-c38bf8589687-0
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.483
I think there was something
called deploying and building a

c09f32ea-c188-46a0-aa7e-c38bf8589687-1
00:05:05.483 --> 00:05:09.278
microservice like I was going
through that document. The steps

c09f32ea-c188-46a0-aa7e-c38bf8589687-2
00:05:09.278 --> 00:05:13.073
you are saying looks similar to
that. Yeah, well, there's also

c09f32ea-c188-46a0-aa7e-c38bf8589687-3
00:05:13.073 --> 00:05:14.820
how do you do deployments to?

df7bc9e4-7080-4b65-915a-6dc2c13d606f-0
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.760
Here we go.

9a0b3e0f-6861-486b-aa02-c6a7e2d71b50-0
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.390
Uh, that's testing one cert.

ccbbcb44-ede8-40e1-af81-5d610613b431-0
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.240
I think it should be inside
creating a microservice.

37d7dca4-e914-4899-af11-c7585979b111-0
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.010
Here's what I wanted you to.

6505fab0-e29e-4374-ab52-10548a0bc9a2-0
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.770
So.

480ca0b0-11e2-44a4-b059-55153057d06d-0
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.870
This wiki article.

114e35e3-fad3-42e6-83d1-0d4453a2cbf7-0
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.070
Explains everything that I just
showed you.

37318896-18e7-4914-bddb-eba21a429072-0
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.290
Although in more detail.

66542979-2183-4f1e-996d-4074691fc2b6-0
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.680
Uh, so it'll it'll tell you how
to, uh.

f2f42b1f-0049-4e04-a27b-466f01f1ff55-0
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.340
Reserve a dev environment build
and deploy microservice.

bb5f38b6-96e7-4ca9-87c5-edb1e6a8898e-0
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.726
Ohh verify deployment so yeah
this this will. This will get

bb5f38b6-96e7-4ca9-87c5-edb1e6a8898e-1
00:05:58.726 --> 00:06:01.580
you unblocked so the next thing
then is.

997d462a-40c9-42f3-a61b-ec193e22b7b9-0
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:03.570
Ohh Danny answered.

ce1002ec-32b5-4e26-8bc7-20858cacc73f-0
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.530
Nope, he didn't answer.

0b655ca1-b26c-45f2-8704-99cbb5337082-0
00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.760
So so my question was why? Why
are we?

cf84b825-242d-4568-af49-9e674e4e0743-0
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.611
Deploying it on a development
environment, so will there be

cf84b825-242d-4568-af49-9e674e4e0743-1
00:06:20.611 --> 00:06:23.824
traffic that we can later on
check on kusto that you know we

cf84b825-242d-4568-af49-9e674e4e0743-2
00:06:23.824 --> 00:06:25.300
we we can make some traffic?

f5986944-fa29-4967-a0c6-ba44f35bee6d-0
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.640
Is it the the The thing is?

47bdd8d6-80a1-423d-8b8e-34ba39e17166-0
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.170
Danny deployed.

59f9bae1-e489-4002-ad45-f3b577f7c140-0
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.160
We we were doing this in.

17ea666d-e298-462f-a5d9-34615fe27152-0
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.640
Canary.

50e98ab5-e8c0-4cb5-8552-c61fc55a29c0-0
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.879
Which was great, except that
Danny deployed some test bits

50e98ab5-e8c0-4cb5-8552-c61fc55a29c0-1
00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:45.088
into Canary for the Fiji
project. It's kind of a high

50e98ab5-e8c0-4cb5-8552-c61fc55a29c0-2
00:06:45.088 --> 00:06:45.790
pressure.

854cdfa7-f190-4215-84ca-39eceda263e8-0
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.213
Deliverable that we have right
now that we we gotta get right

854cdfa7-f190-4215-84ca-39eceda263e8-1
00:06:50.213 --> 00:06:53.556
before is it ignite or build or
you know what one of those

854cdfa7-f190-4215-84ca-39eceda263e8-2
00:06:53.556 --> 00:06:56.673
events is coming up where we
want to, you know, make a

854cdfa7-f190-4215-84ca-39eceda263e8-3
00:06:56.673 --> 00:06:59.790
product announcement. And so we
got to get this right.

22374c02-de92-46e0-97ad-9fbf45982551-0
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.360
And he based his stuff off of
April release.

83ae46ab-ba91-4faa-98f2-5c787be66d30-0
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.940
My stuff was based off of.

e5d2f0d0-a28b-49ff-b9b2-9b9cdcf5789c-0
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.612
And and your stuff was based off
of master, and then there's just

e5d2f0d0-a28b-49ff-b9b2-9b9cdcf5789c-1
00:07:13.612 --> 00:07:15.310
too many things to cherry pick.

c42f222f-aa09-4b7f-a92e-61b48b97d198-0
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.819
To get the stuff in there
because my stuff probably went

c42f222f-aa09-4b7f-a92e-61b48b97d198-1
00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:22.000
in in six commits.

883ad85a-0fa5-4588-901a-07d8a616d922-0
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:29.070
So uh and and and and going back
months, right and and so.

9379e732-4159-455e-a9d8-7203e31abeeb-0
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.998
It just really didn't seem like
a good use of time to figure out

9379e732-4159-455e-a9d8-7203e31abeeb-1
00:07:33.998 --> 00:07:38.277
how to how to get that working,
especially since we're trying to

9379e732-4159-455e-a9d8-7203e31abeeb-2
00:07:38.277 --> 00:07:40.910
snap to the June release this
week, so.

ee8d539c-c519-467a-a6a8-ffe5383aace2-0
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:46.330
That's kind of the issue. So
what we can do.

26052cb5-5ea2-40e3-a899-46bcfc90764c-0
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.490
Is run it on.

da2579a2-8a43-4a25-839d-9ac493dc4d82-0
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.290
A1 box.

fa47a4f5-5ffe-441d-882b-67886eed6703-0
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.935
We're we're working on getting
things working with the one box

fa47a4f5-5ffe-441d-882b-67886eed6703-1
00:08:03.935 --> 00:08:06.854
and then so you at least see
some, you know basic end to end

fa47a4f5-5ffe-441d-882b-67886eed6703-2
00:08:06.854 --> 00:08:09.821
stuff. So you could set up a
service, add some secrets to the

fa47a4f5-5ffe-441d-882b-67886eed6703-3
00:08:09.821 --> 00:08:12.932
service, rotate the service and
I'll be on one box and then then

fa47a4f5-5ffe-441d-882b-67886eed6703-4
00:08:12.932 --> 00:08:15.230
background stuff should happen
on the database.

84cf2600-5352-44d5-be2b-2244c6e05e8f-0
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:21.300
The one box code was written
recently.

90ecf34f-a375-434b-870e-180af8531b95-0
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.090
What we had was we had a one box
and then we.

1ddb937d-9229-41fc-8129-f5ab1416ca9d-0
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:28.490
Change the technologies.

496f8daa-8b0f-4549-84b5-c64239d0d191-0
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:34.012
Underlying or one box we went
from Imos to SQL Server and

496f8daa-8b0f-4549-84b5-c64239d0d191-1
00:08:34.012 --> 00:08:36.210
Fabric to pilot fish and so.

f1dbfb55-4ca1-4cb4-b51b-80cd969d7cfc-0
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.409
The one box really didn't match
the way we run code in

f1dbfb55-4ca1-4cb4-b51b-80cd969d7cfc-1
00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:42.260
production and so the Australia
team.

b29b033e-e6b1-4c37-a5bd-903ad32c6a03-0
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:47.210
Reworked the one box framework
so that it does match.

4caae1b2-da4a-4369-9e8a-d95998c539a6-0
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.510
The way we do things in
production again.

fde5d046-1aa1-44dd-bfa6-8755f8f06bb5-0
00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.360
But it's not perfect yet.

fb63081b-7130-41bd-b8ed-23fa6ab675fa-0
00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:55.050
But uh.

e6ce355a-5398-408d-a909-7ef49ea60d58-0
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:00.946
I think that's probably the best
we can do right now, so I'm

e6ce355a-5398-408d-a909-7ef49ea60d58-1
00:09:00.946 --> 00:09:03.750
trying to think where all of
that stuff is.

b265945d-b3a0-496e-a416-fc6ae3c0191e-0
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.090
All right, let's look in the
code here. Service.

98fef7b6-30d7-450f-94f9-6b2c02212e4f-0
00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:42.210
So in core we've got one Box 1
box launcher.

f47f0a16-780b-49e0-9551-c8b064e4c164-0
00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:02.250


b17f7f5b-19b2-4237-8a43-921983a40e79-0
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:47.600
OK, so I think what I need to do
here is.

84fbb470-9c6d-4b5d-b2fb-63ff9ac0c1b3-0
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:56.810
So I think this one box is our
legacy code.

083cd260-7023-44c2-99d8-df48cec28b67-0
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:04.050
Yeah.

6b178b4a-b36b-48e2-88e0-9b5acf95c56a-0
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.680
So we're looking at.

a575ed21-829b-4290-b809-bdadac046dad-0
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:17.320
Getting this going. I'm just
gonna paste it.

a73c868a-fce0-4e28-a0e1-239937847cbc-0
00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:20.150
Here.

c43b131f-892c-4c95-a6c2-f12f96581ab9-0
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:24.560
It's my pop out here.

cfc73225-814b-4043-8941-36f99a51720e-0
00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:30.890
No.

619959d8-7720-463b-ab27-82a56cd9713b-0
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:50.980


5bb4cb97-9dc0-4610-96da-20cc2a0da4ce-0
00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:59.080
Trying to find where that
documentation is.

1ad4b368-81e8-4801-8082-64c2072f8e84-0
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.110
About when box yeah.

0c3bfd5d-60d5-48c7-a789-a9b3028c9d4f-0
00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:19.150
So the onboarding document that
I was following it has it had.

961f0fe4-f4a0-45f0-bbae-6d82a6ee0c78-0
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:23.030
Like steps to run the one box
and stuff.

5e621dee-221e-4400-9b97-4ff2c142830e-0
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:26.450
Oh, here we go.

33b3c256-5cc7-4d71-80e6-02cb53be516c-0
00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.290
Running the one box PowerShell
script.

b3c46543-4e75-44a0-b6f0-7b540e207f06-0
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:55.100
So yeah, do a build do the
initialization.

728cccc9-cb97-4976-8185-09fc0f626477-0
00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.470
Launch it in PowerShell.

2aac14b9-1aab-433d-9d7a-aa356c4e2d09-0
00:12:58.590 --> 00:12:58.900
Hmm.

a2c37747-41b7-4d90-bfe6-df2b43de8996-0
00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:05.080
And so then what you could do is
you could go include service.

99cc0bc3-d121-49d6-ac8f-6a0c068ff647-0
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:09.625
And if you include the service
like the DSMS distribution

99cc0bc3-d121-49d6-ac8f-6a0c068ff647-1
00:13:09.625 --> 00:13:10.190
packager.

f59e71c8-3741-4cef-b86a-7c210f12c190-0
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:16.192
But that'll run and so if you
include distribution packager

f59e71c8-3741-4cef-b86a-7c210f12c190-1
00:13:16.192 --> 00:13:16.800
and UM.

d4383205-640c-4d85-b4ed-668561cb2d44-0
00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:19.790
DSS launcher.

e9eb7421-2c50-4260-a4a5-511af7cf3936-0
00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:21.850
Then.

decc7c25-46c8-47cf-89a3-dafc1e601934-0
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:28.009
You'll you'll basically have our
service running on your dev box

decc7c25-46c8-47cf-89a3-dafc1e601934-1
00:13:28.009 --> 00:13:32.176
with with the thing that you and
I are building running in the

decc7c25-46c8-47cf-89a3-dafc1e601934-2
00:13:32.176 --> 00:13:36.145
background and then you can do
things like create a secret,

decc7c25-46c8-47cf-89a3-dafc1e601934-3
00:13:36.145 --> 00:13:39.452
create a service, just follow
like the basic DSMS

decc7c25-46c8-47cf-89a3-dafc1e601934-4
00:13:39.452 --> 00:13:43.752
documentation for how to create
a service, and add a secret to a

decc7c25-46c8-47cf-89a3-dafc1e601934-5
00:13:43.752 --> 00:13:47.787
service, rotate a secret and
just do ad hoc secrets and self

decc7c25-46c8-47cf-89a3-dafc1e601934-6
00:13:47.787 --> 00:13:49.110
signed certificates.

c7ace48e-021a-4974-8721-e2e849cf711a-0
00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:52.580
Because those those are super
easy to UM.

f625ef55-1281-40de-9392-1b7d1262500d-0
00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.321
Those are completely
self-contained, right? You don't

f625ef55-1281-40de-9392-1b7d1262500d-1
00:13:56.321 --> 00:13:57.330
have to worry about.

bad102cb-f1b9-4983-af61-9dd5f9c2bf39-0
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.934
Oh, was I able to talk to one
search or the, you know, the

bad102cb-f1b9-4983-af61-9dd5f9c2bf39-1
00:14:03.934 --> 00:14:08.278
various SaaS or anything like
that, right, or storage? So, so

bad102cb-f1b9-4983-af61-9dd5f9c2bf39-2
00:14:08.278 --> 00:14:09.610
ad hoc secrets and.

2a6ea787-66aa-491f-8670-c9a76c900518-0
00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.141
Self signed certificates and I
was gonna show you something.

2a6ea787-66aa-491f-8670-c9a76c900518-1
00:14:14.141 --> 00:14:15.330
What was gonna show you?

e2eef317-fb31-4b2f-8497-b808b57e66a6-0
00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:17.440
Ohh the.

74065dc8-f979-41fd-9f24-40463962fa66-0
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.530
Documentation on how to use
DSMS.

a56a908e-281e-4c4f-b132-4ae5aacc9698-0
00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:33.050
You've you've been here, right?
Yes. OK, I'll go ahead and give

a56a908e-281e-4c4f-b132-4ae5aacc9698-1
00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:34.550
you that link and.

4494365f-0ef2-45f6-8930-24af43f8a32e-0
00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:39.261
Than to learn how DSMS works.
Uh, you've got that on your

4494365f-0ef2-45f6-8930-24af43f8a32e-1
00:14:39.261 --> 00:14:40.830
development environment.

5ddd3809-4c8f-41f6-93ee-681b3012ab82-0
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.040
When you open up git.

e3cabcaf-43d6-4e24-ad9e-84b8df16dbd4-0
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.270
From the git window, just type.

68d92dab-c3a3-474c-9f71-e55e0927e289-0
00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.330
DSMS.

ac144949-e5fa-42e2-a873-7327012b5d53-0
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.980
And that'll.

ebad05a2-17b1-43b6-9948-f41260f6050e-0
00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:53.840
Not work.

ea89663e-ff39-4902-8102-dd8723b58143-0
00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:55.190
What?

c54d0d76-2b81-489a-8467-7338b27eb3a0-0
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.950
Used to work.

75e403ae-adc8-45d1-b59d-feaf06e803f7-0
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:00.040
Interesting.

4e109551-ef7c-4732-aa33-4b5259532828-0
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:03.120
Type out.

88163f70-eccf-4463-a68e-6a8d3cb82af3-0
00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:05.310
CD.

e970602d-ba94-4eff-8668-02d40fa2e867-0
00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:10.840
Detail AMD 64 CD SMS clients.

bf9940b6-8d97-4c82-9d40-a4eaacebe800-0
00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.110
Really. OK.

2d4c571c-f91c-4c81-8089-b4437a3e8a23-0
00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.230
Well, nuts. So anyways.

16b591e7-5e82-483c-be16-cc55abe10c8e-0
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:24.218
I probably cleaned out my build
so I don't have a good SMS

16b591e7-5e82-483c-be16-cc55abe10c8e-1
00:15:24.218 --> 00:15:28.060
client build, but you should be
able to type DSMS client.

0b7a7db3-e2e8-4385-b854-e50fb0d04623-0
00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.050
Anywhere in the end listener.
Here we go. It worked that time.

3d020ff7-ea6f-4687-bf90-350a9e074b8c-0
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.460
If I type DSMS client.exe help.

dd3f22f5-6f27-4038-90f4-0b067fd668a1-0
00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:38.970
Uh.

ce2b3927-80fe-45ad-9d8c-610a4ecdc531-0
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:43.862
Yeah, I can see everything OK.
Yeah. Yeah. And then and then

ce2b3927-80fe-45ad-9d8c-610a4ecdc531-1
00:15:43.862 --> 00:15:46.210
you can do things like help
dash.

475619e6-dc83-4fd2-8af7-222953db598b-0
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:47.920
Commands.

ca481de0-86c2-43b8-8d42-12c3864e16d9-0
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.740
You know, gets dash.

4b5aef6c-61c6-47c4-8611-da745c6b8100-0
00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.360
Nay, and that would give you.

aa74a86a-3610-44c3-a9d3-b0d14b9af1d9-0
00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:03.570
All of the get help and then you
can do things like uh.

acd8a09c-af1e-4ae3-b60c-8cc37176eeae-0
00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.310
Culture ad hoc.

8d3f79f2-c154-4e98-a4a1-c5742dbf9ffc-0
00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:16.589
Secrets and that would show you
everything for ad hoc secrets,

8d3f79f2-c154-4e98-a4a1-c5742dbf9ffc-1
00:16:16.589 --> 00:16:19.240
right. And then the final thing
is.

2bc250bf-1ada-4c0f-b9ad-9b41ab6aac23-0
00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.100
We've got a secret arguments.

9e364b27-ae63-4e2a-a04c-a8a6d4501f86-0
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:27.860
Dash dev info.

e85e7ecd-0ed9-47a7-bd34-b156a993bb37-0
00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:29.200
True.

70306585-b09a-43a7-ada6-b3c860f5269e-0
00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.931
Which just there there there's a
few extra commands in there. So

70306585-b09a-43a7-ada6-b3c860f5269e-1
00:16:36.931 --> 00:16:40.625
what you would want to do is.
This would be a good exercise to

70306585-b09a-43a7-ada6-b3c860f5269e-2
00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:44.377
go through anyways. Just create
a secret, create a service, add

70306585-b09a-43a7-ada6-b3c860f5269e-3
00:16:44.377 --> 00:16:47.719
the secret to the service
against the one box using DSMS

70306585-b09a-43a7-ada6-b3c860f5269e-4
00:16:47.719 --> 00:16:48.130
client.

703941f0-016f-4e2f-b9cb-9df8dc70b3af-0
00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:56.200
Yeah. So that's probably the
best way to to test this stuff

703941f0-016f-4e2f-b9cb-9df8dc70b3af-1
00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.250
at this point.

3af2dd4c-088c-4fc5-bdd6-5cab8209906c-0
00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.930
OK. So OK.

aea29b26-5261-448a-b7e5-3bbcd9b4ae9e-0
00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.951
So there were two different
things we were talking about,

aea29b26-5261-448a-b7e5-3bbcd9b4ae9e-1
00:17:05.951 --> 00:17:08.949
right? I I just got mixed up a
little bit. The first one was

aea29b26-5261-448a-b7e5-3bbcd9b4ae9e-2
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:11.948
the developer in my environment
and the second part is 1 box

aea29b26-5261-448a-b7e5-3bbcd9b4ae9e-3
00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:14.799
like which is purely machine,
right, so so right now with

aea29b26-5261-448a-b7e5-3bbcd9b4ae9e-4
00:17:14.799 --> 00:17:15.930
developer environments.

568ca88d-82fb-45a3-8a2c-a8b96b3030a2-0
00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:22.389
Might be a little too much and
well I I think it's just. It's

568ca88d-82fb-45a3-8a2c-a8b96b3030a2-1
00:17:22.389 --> 00:17:25.690
it's a nonstarter because the
master build is broken.

7f3dc605-4878-40fa-9c3c-dfb37bbe8c80-0
00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:32.192
You're not gonna be able to fix
bugs in it, right? And whereas

7f3dc605-4878-40fa-9c3c-dfb37bbe8c80-1
00:17:32.192 --> 00:17:34.610
this this will be more of a
rapid.

4a9a3e58-4db3-4286-89f4-3d672a90e194-0
00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:38.828
Test thing right, you'll be able
to fix the bug. Kill your one

4a9a3e58-4db3-4286-89f4-3d672a90e194-1
00:17:38.828 --> 00:17:41.210
box, restart your one box you
know and go.

ea372521-7e3d-4690-8cc5-9e94068b9eff-0
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:43.310
And.

d6e5a04a-46b6-4b0f-923e-f9c39d196911-0
00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:48.191
I I think that this would be
good enough and that this will.

d6e5a04a-46b6-4b0f-923e-f9c39d196911-1
00:17:48.191 --> 00:17:50.842
This will give you confidence
that your codes working. Now

d6e5a04a-46b6-4b0f-923e-f9c39d196911-2
00:17:50.842 --> 00:17:52.459
what you won't have necessarily
is.

248224d1-dd38-4a35-8746-98c5e4be591c-0
00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.750
Stuff going to Cousteau, but in
the one box.

44528e5a-b287-4ed2-9929-835dea28e91d-0
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.940
If they did it right.

2159ba33-e99a-4314-b1d6-ea871f842db3-0
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:06.770
You know, and I know they did.

1faefb76-02d7-44f9-a924-83362c75976d-0
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:11.294
A lot of the stuff that would
the the lot, the trace events

1faefb76-02d7-44f9-a924-83362c75976d-1
00:18:11.294 --> 00:18:14.719
and such that that you added
that that are would go to kusto,

1faefb76-02d7-44f9-a924-83362c75976d-2
00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:15.990
they go to the console.

ec3498c8-f6e9-4457-8cd5-a431e87ccf7b-0
00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:17.820
So.

fcb39db8-bcd0-4c6a-a711-681642d5dd25-0
00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.782
You should. You should be able
to see those traces events that

fcb39db8-bcd0-4c6a-a711-681642d5dd25-1
00:18:21.782 --> 00:18:24.981
you added. Yes, I think there's
a different table called SMS

fcb39db8-bcd0-4c6a-a711-681642d5dd25-2
00:18:24.981 --> 00:18:27.550
test. Something in Kusto where
where we can see.

0c4a7a0e-e5a4-49d0-8582-e587f9ae3fd2-0
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:31.879
Even specific to one box did did
they do that? OK, cool. I'm

0c4a7a0e-e5a4-49d0-8582-e587f9ae3fd2-1
00:18:31.879 --> 00:18:34.892
like, I mean, I I read that
somewhere. I don't know. Oht.

0c4a7a0e-e5a4-49d0-8582-e587f9ae3fd2-2
00:18:34.892 --> 00:18:35.880
Yeah. Look at that.

1aadb2af-733b-4524-b8b0-aa9c070722f1-0
00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.420
OK, so so maybe.

f1f85412-c763-4b9b-b5a2-d7b667ad1ec3-0
00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:48.182
That's cool. I like that. OK, so
yeah, they they've been doing

f1f85412-c763-4b9b-b5a2-d7b667ad1ec3-1
00:18:48.182 --> 00:18:51.622
stuff. Now. I know there's been
some frustration about the

f1f85412-c763-4b9b-b5a2-d7b667ad1ec3-2
00:18:51.622 --> 00:18:53.080
stability of the one box.

0864ff58-9cfe-4f5c-940f-43233018b583-0
00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:58.946
Like it maybe not watching for
you, but like the best we can do

0864ff58-9cfe-4f5c-940f-43233018b583-1
00:18:58.946 --> 00:19:03.082
is just start using it and then
reporting those bugs to the AQI

0864ff58-9cfe-4f5c-940f-43233018b583-2
00:19:03.082 --> 00:19:07.282
team and starting to fix those.
Our vision for the one box right

0864ff58-9cfe-4f5c-940f-43233018b583-3
00:19:07.282 --> 00:19:07.800
is that.

96cf7e23-e3f8-407b-b8af-58c6f65d9a4a-0
00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:13.974
But you're somebody in your
position starts up right? You

96cf7e23-e3f8-407b-b8af-58c6f65d9a4a-1
00:19:13.974 --> 00:19:18.185
enlist with you, get your you
clone, you get repository, you

96cf7e23-e3f8-407b-b8af-58c6f65d9a4a-2
00:19:18.185 --> 00:19:18.600
build.

d477454c-86b1-4056-8477-e5d430745f4c-0
00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.520
You fire up the one box and
you've got the service running

d477454c-86b1-4056-8477-e5d430745f4c-1
00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.441
on your box that day. That
that's what we're trying to get

d477454c-86b1-4056-8477-e5d430745f4c-2
00:19:25.441 --> 00:19:25.590
to.

68171b5d-9e9e-4600-bff7-a0167d17ee9b-0
00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:32.044
We're not there yet, but you're
the person who's most qualified

68171b5d-9e9e-4600-bff7-a0167d17ee9b-1
00:19:32.044 --> 00:19:36.471
to tell us how useful this stuff
is, and then we need to fix

68171b5d-9e9e-4600-bff7-a0167d17ee9b-2
00:19:36.471 --> 00:19:37.559
those bugs. So.

c30cf2c9-fcb1-4504-b80d-954c958344b1-0
00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:40.450
Yeah, sounds good. Yeah. And uh.

b3006df9-c1b7-4511-a25a-39d305cc2686-0
00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:45.540
Yeah, you you may end up being
the one who fixes them too.

22531e11-9bec-4a17-abee-28507b808efb-0
00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:53.900
I have two questions. The first
one was the first is like I keep

22531e11-9bec-4a17-abee-28507b808efb-1
00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:58.745
seeing like retail- something
and and debug- AMD 64. So these

22531e11-9bec-4a17-abee-28507b808efb-2
00:19:58.745 --> 00:20:03.513
are like two different kinds of
builds three different build

22531e11-9bec-4a17-abee-28507b808efb-3
00:20:03.513 --> 00:20:08.515
outputs. So what gets deployed
to production is retail dash AMD

22531e11-9bec-4a17-abee-28507b808efb-4
00:20:08.515 --> 00:20:08.750
64.

12966a39-b1f2-4372-9d90-b5984fb5363e-0
00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:14.810
I don't know if we do anything
with the arm 64, honestly. So

12966a39-b1f2-4372-9d90-b5984fb5363e-1
00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:16.100
there's one debug-

3597e349-9926-4474-87c7-c03ba88cbb6c-0
00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.530
that's just for, you know, debug
symbols, debug builds.

a18b3df5-8c9b-4a37-af2a-587f12755b8c-0
00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.040
We don't send that to
production.

f62f12a9-fd2c-4577-96d4-634ae7be6a65-0
00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:29.440
OK, so so if I use UH-1 box, I
mean probably should.

6a833183-4bb1-462b-b550-fee726b0f3f3-0
00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:34.181
Point to a retail build outs,
right? Well, it'll you'll point

6a833183-4bb1-462b-b550-fee726b0f3f3-1
00:20:34.181 --> 00:20:38.349
to whatever you build locally,
right? If you do a debug build,

6a833183-4bb1-462b-b550-fee726b0f3f3-2
00:20:38.349 --> 00:20:42.319
then you can actually step into
the code and debug it as it

6a833183-4bb1-462b-b550-fee726b0f3f3-3
00:20:42.319 --> 00:20:42.650
runs.

1af819e8-ac12-4152-a1f7-e962b32f977c-0
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:47.713
OK. Yeah. Yeah, because because
when we when we use like a build

1af819e8-ac12-4152-a1f7-e962b32f977c-1
00:20:47.713 --> 00:20:51.000
command the two folders
generated in the out directory

1af819e8-ac12-4152-a1f7-e962b32f977c-2
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.764
the file, yeah retail- lick and
the second one is debug- I was

1af819e8-ac12-4152-a1f7-e962b32f977c-3
00:20:54.764 --> 00:20:58.409
just curious like whether these
two things are like the same

1af819e8-ac12-4152-a1f7-e962b32f977c-4
00:20:58.409 --> 00:21:00.800
when I'm concerned like as a
developer.

4e5dd2f8-8322-4edc-8acb-f553dbe98eec-0
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:03.420
So as a developer.

5574fd45-d170-419a-bb74-5c8260ff28a6-0
00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.837
So. So the retail bill is gonna
run faster because it doesn't

5574fd45-d170-419a-bb74-5c8260ff28a6-1
00:21:07.837 --> 00:21:10.270
have all those debug symbols and
and hooks, right?

019350c3-4651-40a4-aa34-7634c180e483-0
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.740
But.

b9892871-845c-478e-80ec-fd7b6b8f2f10-0
00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:20.024
You know, you also aren't gonna
be able to step into the code

b9892871-845c-478e-80ec-fd7b6b8f2f10-1
00:21:20.024 --> 00:21:21.050
with a debugger.

53242e1b-7a00-4f2d-a5c0-8380927ba61c-0
00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:26.189
Which at whereas you could with
UM a debug build. Yeah, that,

53242e1b-7a00-4f2d-a5c0-8380927ba61c-1
00:21:26.189 --> 00:21:30.310
that, that sounds helpful. Yeah.
And the second thing was.

73d18027-63d0-4e08-93d8-6a4ae5f82602-0
00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:36.517
So. So the service that I was
touching and we were working on,

73d18027-63d0-4e08-93d8-6a4ae5f82602-1
00:21:36.517 --> 00:21:40.295
they they are a part of
distribution package manager,

73d18027-63d0-4e08-93d8-6a4ae5f82602-2
00:21:40.295 --> 00:21:44.702
right, right, right. So where is
this mapping in the code base

73d18027-63d0-4e08-93d8-6a4ae5f82602-3
00:21:44.702 --> 00:21:48.830
like where are these names
defined? Sure. Let me show you.

883702da-7ce7-4a5f-83d0-59256752180f-0
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:52.400
So.

a65e2fb2-7418-40ab-a237-17d6828ae6f8-0
00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:59.281
And we talked about we've got
the core service core

a65e2fb2-7418-40ab-a237-17d6828ae6f8-1
00:21:59.281 --> 00:22:02.550
distribution, right, so
everything.

490dcb2a-01eb-40ed-9eae-9f6a761320b5-0
00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:09.513
All of the core business logic
and plumbing with the database

490dcb2a-01eb-40ed-9eae-9f6a761320b5-1
00:22:09.513 --> 00:22:13.969
and everything happens here that
this is. This is where our

490dcb2a-01eb-40ed-9eae-9f6a761320b5-2
00:22:13.969 --> 00:22:17.756
libraries that are related to
distribution go. The

490dcb2a-01eb-40ed-9eae-9f6a761320b5-3
00:22:17.756 --> 00:22:22.509
distribution packager is going
to have another folder inside of

490dcb2a-01eb-40ed-9eae-9f6a761320b5-4
00:22:22.509 --> 00:22:23.920
service pilot fish.

70dd747e-cbb1-4782-9513-c63def808d28-0
00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:30.951
And then DSMS, we're a little
bit out of control here with

70dd747e-cbb1-4782-9513-c63def808d28-1
00:22:30.951 --> 00:22:32.070
other folders.

6891251a-0dec-4363-86fc-ef0f050245d1-0
00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:39.390
DSMS distribution packager and
this is basically the plumbing.

7cb7cf22-505a-45a5-8afd-bda7430be3d4-0
00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:43.831
That runs the thing, right? So
you wanna you wanna do most of

7cb7cf22-505a-45a5-8afd-bda7430be3d4-1
00:22:43.831 --> 00:22:44.360
the coding?

24f5f01a-e61b-463c-97de-3cadecb9894b-0
00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:45.960
Up here.

164a89cb-9f96-4d7a-bca3-c345d6f8936c-0
00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:49.578
Because this is gonna be the
stuff that's easy to hook into

164a89cb-9f96-4d7a-bca3-c345d6f8936c-1
00:22:49.578 --> 00:22:52.144
unit tests where you can
basically test it anywhere and

164a89cb-9f96-4d7a-bca3-c345d6f8936c-2
00:22:52.144 --> 00:22:52.740
all the time.

c70c21cf-2f8a-4202-8029-92b2138906d2-0
00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:58.521
And then the only stuff you
wanna put here is that stuff

c70c21cf-2f8a-4202-8029-92b2138906d2-1
00:22:58.521 --> 00:23:03.150
that just fires it up, right? So
if you look at program dot CS.

02be3eee-0c2b-4a8f-9037-ef58eb99a473-0
00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:06.723
There's a few things like, you
know, firing up the logging and

02be3eee-0c2b-4a8f-9037-ef58eb99a473-1
00:23:06.723 --> 00:23:07.950
then, you know, in the run.

ee08b9fe-0a6e-40ea-b57d-885fe164f5e5-0
00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:17.188
We basically this is the the
guts of the service, right? This

ee08b9fe-0a6e-40ea-b57d-885fe164f5e5-1
00:23:17.188 --> 00:23:18.910
packager is part of.

e733ef86-45ef-4db1-9fcc-6cfc0e30a751-0
00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:21.370
UM.

202925e9-632d-4470-b9ed-71c5cee20005-0
00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:26.480
It's it's the distribution
package or that's part of the

202925e9-632d-4470-b9ed-71c5cee20005-1
00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:30.084
core distribution folder, right?
We just loaded up and then we

202925e9-632d-4470-b9ed-71c5cee20005-2
00:23:30.084 --> 00:23:32.030
say run and then that's going
to.

fd0e4855-7b6a-49f2-bd69-8d138b28984e-0
00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.870
Feed into.

05de9e30-f9d6-41a6-9e05-63191ab6d3dc-0
00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.200
This guy here in core.

fd7f7776-2ed0-4768-b5d1-76ef8d745ec6-0
00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.810
OK, right. And so, UM.

d875f62f-7d99-4c92-ae33-beca2d130d06-0
00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:47.640
But if we look at this program.

e23553cd-2ad9-4620-91ef-19cdfdb80204-0
00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:51.130
Here's where the one box becomes
kind of cool.

70f9ac99-8c62-4655-b652-5dbb3da85592-0
00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:56.560
One of the things that it does
is, UM.

638896da-110f-478b-835f-d1a4b8c2d55b-0
00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:02.346
It takes some common command
line arguments. One of the

638896da-110f-478b-835f-d1a4b8c2d55b-1
00:24:02.346 --> 00:24:03.830
command lines is.

00fe2fab-3852-4511-b5b6-b6e22d233c7a-0
00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:08.988
You know, inside of run, if I'm
running on A1 box and you don't

00fe2fab-3852-4511-b5b6-b6e22d233c7a-1
00:24:08.988 --> 00:24:12.328
have to write any of that code,
it's just going to know, hey,

00fe2fab-3852-4511-b5b6-b6e22d233c7a-2
00:24:12.328 --> 00:24:13.460
I'm on A1 box, right?

b06830d4-aace-4732-b9cd-99b80588fc2b-0
00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.780
And you passed in the debug
option.

befcfe2d-7d7a-448d-a968-89cec4308623-0
00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.400
Then it's going to launch the
debugger for you.

073aa998-0119-4d4b-8d35-ce133e82839c-0
00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:24.760
With the break point. So you
just put like a a break point.

acde3174-48ee-41db-bb5f-ef1b90b97265-0
00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:26.260
Here.

3add1f1a-3599-401a-9aa3-c60fd506406c-0
00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.300
And then.

d279c769-21c7-4ce9-b8d4-ae70aa583fbf-0
00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:32.397
When you launch your one box,
there's a a command line option

d279c769-21c7-4ce9-b8d4-ae70aa583fbf-1
00:24:32.397 --> 00:24:35.725
you can pass into the the one
box PowerShell script that says

d279c769-21c7-4ce9-b8d4-ae70aa583fbf-2
00:24:35.725 --> 00:24:36.960
hey, I'm in debug mode.

03fbe00a-5e62-422c-9352-f87116109992-0
00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:41.348
Boom, you're it'll fire up
Visual Studio and you're

03fbe00a-5e62-422c-9352-f87116109992-1
00:24:41.348 --> 00:24:44.060
stepping through the code, which
I don't think.

8703ffe4-a647-49da-b57b-9423ff126ef8-0
00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:51.522
We can do that in pilot fish at
all and like some of the old

8703ffe4-a647-49da-b57b-9423ff126ef8-1
00:24:51.522 --> 00:24:54.300
versions of Autopilot, it was
supported.

129f084c-1d01-4f63-9dbb-2370da1f0cf4-0
00:24:56.140 --> 00:25:00.016
But all the documentation I was
able to find on it was like, you

129f084c-1d01-4f63-9dbb-2370da1f0cf4-1
00:25:00.016 --> 00:25:03.833
know from 2014 and so much has
changed since then and and pilot

129f084c-1d01-4f63-9dbb-2370da1f0cf4-2
00:25:03.833 --> 00:25:07.411
fish is supposed to be this
locked down secure environment.

129f084c-1d01-4f63-9dbb-2370da1f0cf4-3
00:25:07.411 --> 00:25:10.990
So I would be really surprised
if we supported that at all.

9a1c9123-4d7d-46ce-9bc3-cf1cc96c756e-0
00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:17.270
But you know and and and this is
easy, right? It's. Yeah.

dcf0717d-93aa-4484-9eaf-217574122866-0
00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:22.674
I've done remote debugging on a
production environment. You got

dcf0717d-93aa-4484-9eaf-217574122866-1
00:25:22.674 --> 00:25:26.020
to put so many things in place
and it's so fragile and.

6b017937-ea60-4c5a-9cbc-95fcdd70b125-0
00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:27.960
Umm.

55b3ec78-6f49-4c59-ae44-9815c3b5c467-0
00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:29.070
So yeah.

4dea1b2d-9dd5-4e30-a30f-8550a5277c0a-0
00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:31.770
So so this run method.

b27d243b-4c11-41b9-8046-4022171e03e3-0
00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:36.139
In program so program dot CS is
pretty much presented. All of

b27d243b-4c11-41b9-8046-4022171e03e3-1
00:25:36.139 --> 00:25:37.720
these folders towards right.

526ff4d2-95ba-4c8e-9375-eb21a12c9e6d-0
00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:43.189
Great. Uh. Like, like in the
distribution packages, it must

526ff4d2-95ba-4c8e-9375-eb21a12c9e6d-1
00:25:43.189 --> 00:25:47.684
be also be in the SSMS bootstrap
or whatever it is in in many of

526ff4d2-95ba-4c8e-9375-eb21a12c9e6d-2
00:25:47.684 --> 00:25:48.030
them.

6a0705bf-a9aa-4862-aeb9-1666e694a640-0
00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:54.543
This was like my boilerplate
microservice creation code,

6a0705bf-a9aa-4862-aeb9-1666e694a640-1
00:25:54.543 --> 00:25:54.990
yeah.

657fa2bd-22e2-4a38-939e-faeded5c4694-0
00:25:56.670 --> 00:26:00.599
You know that's evolved with
time as as we discover things.

657fa2bd-22e2-4a38-939e-faeded5c4694-1
00:26:00.599 --> 00:26:04.593
Ohh we really useful if we did
it this way, right? So if you

657fa2bd-22e2-4a38-939e-faeded5c4694-2
00:26:04.593 --> 00:26:06.100
look at a lot of these.

5593da0d-00ee-4f30-ad94-3c0fb772d949-0
00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:10.676
Console apps. They'll all look a
little bit different and a lot

5593da0d-00ee-4f30-ad94-3c0fb772d949-1
00:26:10.676 --> 00:26:12.270
of times that's just because.

02c23f7e-f5a8-4b10-b49e-cde87467cb40-0
00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:17.839
Well, the the tool had evolved
right to do things a little bit

02c23f7e-f5a8-4b10-b49e-cde87467cb40-1
00:26:17.839 --> 00:26:21.458
differently and and sometimes we
go back and retroactively fix

02c23f7e-f5a8-4b10-b49e-cde87467cb40-2
00:26:21.458 --> 00:26:24.905
things and sometimes we don't.
It's kind of on an as needed

02c23f7e-f5a8-4b10-b49e-cde87467cb40-3
00:26:24.905 --> 00:26:25.250
basis.

f483fe00-3f32-41ff-8500-c795953d547e-0
00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.120
So.

b9ff949d-1fa2-4afb-a64e-af67354fa9cf-0
00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:31.452
You know we we've got, we've got
a high number of services that

b9ff949d-1fa2-4afb-a64e-af67354fa9cf-1
00:26:31.452 --> 00:26:34.897
just always work and we've we've
never had to go back and change

b9ff949d-1fa2-4afb-a64e-af67354fa9cf-2
00:26:34.897 --> 00:26:36.170
anything about them, so.

8cf5575d-cef6-4cde-bb85-5b052a35757e-0
00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:41.652
Yeah. Yeah. So the line number
18 SDS distribution package or

8cf5575d-cef6-4cde-bb85-5b052a35757e-1
00:26:41.652 --> 00:26:45.794
the name of the service that
with our original like source

8cf5575d-cef6-4cde-bb85-5b052a35757e-2
00:26:45.794 --> 00:26:50.427
code of this. Yeah. So what that
maps up to is that will match up

8cf5575d-cef6-4cde-bb85-5b052a35757e-3
00:26:50.427 --> 00:26:54.288
with the folder. And then
there's this service map ini

8cf5575d-cef6-4cde-bb85-5b052a35757e-4
00:26:54.288 --> 00:26:54.639
file.

56101b15-64f5-472b-962d-a6f2135b0c9e-0
00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:59.000
And now you'll see this in every
single.

a13e2a8d-f4d9-4a6b-a727-cb1971da7482-0
00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:05.271
Service folder there's gonna be
this SMS service map I and I but

a13e2a8d-f4d9-4a6b-a727-cb1971da7482-1
00:27:05.271 --> 00:27:05.990
it's linked.

796d663b-e3af-48c2-b6ce-04e563916795-0
00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:08.620
If you look at the properties of
it.

0f0773dc-c479-495f-a03a-d82c6fc99073-0
00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.850
It's a build action. None.

e760ccd8-19a8-482d-b506-6dfb9be44c9c-0
00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:15.000
Umm.

232308ab-0c12-4be3-9f19-621aa4a54bab-0
00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:19.922
It it all maps to the same
location, it's it's just a link,

232308ab-0c12-4be3-9f19-621aa4a54bab-1
00:27:19.922 --> 00:27:23.864
it's not a copy of the file
service map I defines. What are

232308ab-0c12-4be3-9f19-621aa4a54bab-2
00:27:23.864 --> 00:27:27.149
all of the services and so on a
DSMS app machine.

b8593793-dcf4-4c97-bc62-6c063f1a3102-0
00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:32.253
We've got the distribution
packager running and this this

b8593793-dcf4-4c97-bc62-6c063f1a3102-1
00:27:32.253 --> 00:27:35.530
executable is gonna launch every
60 seconds.

9f901a9b-510f-48b6-a55a-950652060d95-0
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:37.870
Hmm, OK.

159d9c4d-98ce-4384-b0cb-3a2e9f27d727-0
00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:46.419
And what is the 2nd argument?
The zero? Uh, I don't remember.

159d9c4d-98ce-4384-b0cb-3a2e9f27d727-1
00:27:46.419 --> 00:27:48.210
I I think it's.

196da3cd-4ced-4057-a7fa-f659961e7239-0
00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:54.362
If you look in the documentation
as something like this is

196da3cd-4ced-4057-a7fa-f659961e7239-1
00:27:54.362 --> 00:27:57.570
reserved by a pilot fish. Always
set it to 0 so.

a6439ed5-ac4e-4d37-b7f1-bb5ff4252a24-0
00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:02.592
Is this the first one? Is the
one that we care about? OK.

a6439ed5-ac4e-4d37-b7f1-bb5ff4252a24-1
00:28:02.592 --> 00:28:04.610
Yeah. And like, if you set it
to.

6ca24496-39bb-4a4a-975e-850a0b63884d-0
00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:11.170
0, zero. That means it is a long
running service.

dcc64d74-98ce-429b-bd39-3cf3ae8d0eee-0
00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:13.460
If it.

83afe790-ec90-4c35-9f9c-460d24a18c82-0
00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.570
Stops running and restarted
immediately.

a78b44e5-a663-4d8a-807d-1c22ddbcdbeb-0
00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:21.630
OK, like like SQL connectivity.
This. Yeah. And then if you set

a78b44e5-a663-4d8a-807d-1c22ddbcdbeb-1
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:24.350
it to negative one, it's never
running.

900be634-b51c-43c6-bc8a-327ca8f013dc-0
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:30.366
And it said something and and so
like for example we have this

900be634-b51c-43c6-bc8a-327ca8f013dc-1
00:28:30.366 --> 00:28:32.610
thing called DSMS SQL tools.

c19120a9-fc4c-41bf-a6d6-ab13a346de00-0
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:40.175
Yeah, 12 line number, right. And
that's just a place where we

c19120a9-fc4c-41bf-a6d6-ab13a346de00-1
00:28:40.175 --> 00:28:44.120
dump various executables that
might be useful to have on a on

c19120a9-fc4c-41bf-a6d6-ab13a346de00-2
00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:45.329
a DSMS SQL machine.

0a972d3e-196d-4ff8-90e3-bfd3b0d139f5-0
00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:52.452
OK. And yes, sorry, uh, negative
means don't run it ever. Like,

0a972d3e-196d-4ff8-90e3-bfd3b0d139f5-1
00:28:52.452 --> 00:28:56.086
if I want to do it, I'll do it.
These autopilot won't run it

0a972d3e-196d-4ff8-90e3-bfd3b0d139f5-2
00:28:56.086 --> 00:28:56.920
automatically.

96634bdd-a395-4611-a504-d71ae10c2b59-0
00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:01.679
OK. But you know it's still
there and and so we've got a

96634bdd-a395-4611-a504-d71ae10c2b59-1
00:29:01.679 --> 00:29:05.559
few, a few of our TSG, you'll
see. Hey, go to the DSMS SQL

96634bdd-a395-4611-a504-d71ae10c2b59-2
00:29:05.559 --> 00:29:09.111
Tools folder and run this
executable. That's one that

96634bdd-a395-4611-a504-d71ae10c2b59-3
00:29:09.111 --> 00:29:10.230
we've written so.

02a033a4-3892-4598-bc9e-c4213f3b0ca7-0
00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:15.913
And and and the square bracket
stuff like line number one and

02a033a4-3892-4598-bc9e-c4213f3b0ca7-1
00:29:15.913 --> 00:29:20.209
six and 35. These are just a way
to bifurcate these. Yeah,

02a033a4-3892-4598-bc9e-c4213f3b0ca7-2
00:29:20.209 --> 00:29:24.431
they're just section headers,
right? So. So these are the

02a033a4-3892-4598-bc9e-c4213f3b0ca7-3
00:29:24.431 --> 00:29:28.872
services. So you have service
lists and they've got the DSMS

02a033a4-3892-4598-bc9e-c4213f3b0ca7-4
00:29:28.872 --> 00:29:32.949
SQL equals SQL service list
which matches up with this,

02a033a4-3892-4598-bc9e-c4213f3b0ca7-5
00:29:32.949 --> 00:29:36.880
right. And so these are
basically all of the services

02a033a4-3892-4598-bc9e-c4213f3b0ca7-6
00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.720
that you'll see on a DSMS SQL
machine.

49c92236-b685-46d5-b898-fdaa7f59905b-0
00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:44.855
Similarly for DSS app that maps
to these guys, these are all the

49c92236-b685-46d5-b898-fdaa7f59905b-1
00:29:44.855 --> 00:29:48.200
guys that you'll see on a DS app
machine and so.

a4a63bca-81b0-4855-a59b-c56b8d4ab002-0
00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:52.400
I can show you what I'm talking
about here in XTS.

2a2c837f-a41a-4b73-9629-5461ca6cba0f-0
00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.940
Just call up one of our
environments.

8d38834e-57a4-4b89-9cfe-474993cfb9b1-0
00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:05.650
So when you boot up XTS there is
this in your saw or local. This

8d38834e-57a4-4b89-9cfe-474993cfb9b1-1
00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:10.800
is on my developer machine right
now. You'll have it on your saw

8d38834e-57a4-4b89-9cfe-474993cfb9b1-2
00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:15.553
too. On the saw you can do
everything here. I can only read

8d38834e-57a4-4b89-9cfe-474993cfb9b1-3
00:30:15.553 --> 00:30:18.010
on the saw. I would be able to.

895c4598-10d1-4618-9bc3-2712321d8047-0
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:21.743
You know, execute a command to
say hey, reboot this machine or

895c4598-10d1-4618-9bc3-2712321d8047-1
00:30:21.743 --> 00:30:22.580
something like that.

9a8c2de2-7810-4b77-8762-e0c9065962d8-0
00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:24.010
Gotcha.

dca40fa4-6b92-42ff-b6fb-5d03464d9c27-0
00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:29.020
Yeah, this like I'm scared of
XTS. This view is so horrifying.

2178a0cb-d271-4f56-b133-264ba091089f-0
00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:36.224
Too much information. Yeah,
there's it's a sharp learning

2178a0cb-d271-4f56-b133-264ba091089f-1
00:30:36.224 --> 00:30:37.880
curve. I won't lie.

8dcbc2e7-129a-403b-8325-4aeb7d595d95-0
00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:44.790
Excuse me, really grown to love
it because it it has everything

8dcbc2e7-129a-403b-8325-4aeb7d595d95-1
00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:49.191
you need and I really like the
fact that it's in a Windows app

8dcbc2e7-129a-403b-8325-4aeb7d595d95-2
00:30:49.191 --> 00:30:50.170
as opposed to.

94dfd81d-85e1-4848-99cb-f951def05d64-0
00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:52.190
You know, here's.

76bd76d5-c323-4509-90cd-2656a0f717ce-0
00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:58.105
1000 you know, little web pages
that you know, some of them

76bd76d5-c323-4509-90cd-2656a0f717ce-1
00:30:58.105 --> 00:30:58.780
perform.

8ca543e1-208a-4658-893e-13886be06dde-0
00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.370
Don't you know perform better
than others? And you know, this

8ca543e1-208a-4658-893e-13886be06dde-1
00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:03.800
is like.

6389d106-4d1f-4555-b556-f23241e70d1c-0
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:05.330
Umm.

38b911f9-73ec-455f-9cec-d60e8ac61e76-0
00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:11.060
You're constantly reaching out
to the machines to get the

38b911f9-73ec-455f-9cec-d60e8ac61e76-1
00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:14.360
current status and so, but let
let me just show you like.

691dac96-324b-4112-9807-815e2b55a047-0
00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:18.973
I'll show you some other cool
things we can do here. So DSMS

691dac96-324b-4112-9807-815e2b55a047-1
00:31:18.973 --> 00:31:21.510
app by right click and say
machine view.

0c6a6fc4-baa9-4351-9042-80b4f7416ff8-0
00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:27.820
It's gonna show us some high
level stuff about this machine.

f2407071-8699-4d4c-bfef-273710f877ec-0
00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.971
Up in this upper right hand
corner is going to show us the

f2407071-8699-4d4c-bfef-273710f877ec-1
00:31:30.971 --> 00:31:32.670
services that are running on
this machine.

a319f0c4-0596-44d2-97a1-fe4574ea62ff-0
00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:38.460
And what you'll see is.

59827c25-fdf0-4df4-b943-a0e18c0154aa-0
00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:43.023
The name of the service is going
to be some string dot and then

59827c25-fdf0-4df4-b943-a0e18c0154aa-1
00:31:43.023 --> 00:31:46.978
this thing is is identifying the
build number and so you can see

59827c25-fdf0-4df4-b943-a0e18c0154aa-2
00:31:46.978 --> 00:31:50.263
that this is. These are
developer pipeline builds but

59827c25-fdf0-4df4-b943-a0e18c0154aa-3
00:31:50.263 --> 00:31:50.750
you can.

7b1458e3-1496-4bab-be72-38b9e256f630-0
00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:54.130
Match these up with.

238bed41-415d-48f5-a7c2-f8776289655a-0
00:31:58.960 --> 00:31:59.750
Wait a minute.

10a47147-58f8-4e7b-ada3-470e15fd47cb-0
00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.250
You can match these up with the
stuff that.

520933a0-c502-4b57-a5ed-04238d397801-0
00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:09.464
You were seeing in this list, so
there's going to be a DSMS app

520933a0-c502-4b57-a5ed-04238d397801-1
00:32:09.464 --> 00:32:13.253
service, an OS feature
installer, and if we pop into

520933a0-c502-4b57-a5ed-04238d397801-2
00:32:13.253 --> 00:32:15.040
here then I go to filter.

fb7630d3-c0b8-4300-9623-b70623240238-0
00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:18.260
There's our OS feature
installer.

b6ff6498-db4f-469e-b792-f187f02c233c-0
00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:24.076
Right. And you'll see the same
thing for the DSMS SQL machines,

b6ff6498-db4f-469e-b792-f187f02c233c-1
00:32:24.076 --> 00:32:28.993
right? So DSMS app and DSMS SQL
we call those machine functions

b6ff6498-db4f-469e-b792-f187f02c233c-2
00:32:28.993 --> 00:32:30.760
in pilot fish parlance.

7ceb0bd7-0638-4d57-8bf1-b8b565383694-0
00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:34.400
And that's what maps up with.

73c27e90-da49-46f6-bc79-d718bbec9f79-0
00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:36.920
Uh.

de3964f5-cd1e-49ea-be1e-929d475e9c38-0
00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:41.828
These values like use the SMS
SQL machine function maps to

de3964f5-cd1e-49ea-be1e-929d475e9c38-1
00:32:41.828 --> 00:32:45.690
this service list, DS app
machine function maps to this

de3964f5-cd1e-49ea-be1e-929d475e9c38-2
00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:47.070
service list, right?

e84fdee9-a862-479b-813e-4e4211a942a7-0
00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:48.420
Umm.

5c90177d-29cb-4735-a767-bc4c8820cce2-0
00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:55.173
So one thing I commonly do in in
the XTS is I'll come here and if

5c90177d-29cb-4735-a767-bc4c8820cce2-1
00:32:55.173 --> 00:32:59.907
the machines unhappy you can
check the status. It's gonna be

5c90177d-29cb-4735-a767-bc4c8820cce2-2
00:32:59.907 --> 00:33:02.780
either H for healthy, F for
failing.

6ef906cc-3b19-44c2-abb1-033195d6056a-0
00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:08.497
P for in probation, meaning it's
been, it's healthy, it looks

6ef906cc-3b19-44c2-abb1-033195d6056a-1
00:33:08.497 --> 00:33:11.948
healthy, but it hasn't been
healthy for very long. So it's

6ef906cc-3b19-44c2-abb1-033195d6056a-2
00:33:11.948 --> 00:33:15.283
on probation. We're we're
waiting. And then you've got D

6ef906cc-3b19-44c2-abb1-033195d6056a-3
00:33:15.283 --> 00:33:18.968
for dead, which means that we
have to go in and take some kind

6ef906cc-3b19-44c2-abb1-033195d6056a-4
00:33:18.968 --> 00:33:21.660
of action. Any other state, it's
going to be.

2817d629-014d-4527-9433-3f5b8ecd350e-0
00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:28.519
You know, going through like
this self healing life cycle of

2817d629-014d-4527-9433-3f5b8ecd350e-1
00:33:28.519 --> 00:33:32.207
if it's not healthy, it's gonna
go. Oh well, I'm not healthy.

2817d629-014d-4527-9433-3f5b8ecd350e-2
00:33:32.207 --> 00:33:36.134
Try restarting the service. Ohh,
well then. OK. Restarting didn't

2817d629-014d-4527-9433-3f5b8ecd350e-3
00:33:36.134 --> 00:33:39.584
work three times. Let's just
reboot the machine. OK, that

2817d629-014d-4527-9433-3f5b8ecd350e-4
00:33:39.584 --> 00:33:43.452
didn't work. Well, let's try an
image on the machine. Right. And

2817d629-014d-4527-9433-3f5b8ecd350e-5
00:33:43.452 --> 00:33:47.021
Autopilot is doing that for us.
As long as we our code sets

2817d629-014d-4527-9433-3f5b8ecd350e-6
00:33:47.021 --> 00:33:48.390
these values correctly.

a76ecc19-923e-41cf-878a-1ea10828aa92-0
00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:51.830
Then you know the whole thing
becomes kind of hands free.

68fe1ad9-47b4-4658-ada0-f923048deb67-0
00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:59.124
So yeah, so, so that's great.
Yeah. So so the the key pieces

68fe1ad9-47b4-4658-ada0-f923048deb67-1
00:33:59.124 --> 00:34:03.062
of information. So like looking
here looking at the status of

68fe1ad9-47b4-4658-ada0-f923048deb67-2
00:34:03.062 --> 00:34:06.936
machines, right click, machine
view and then check the stuff

68fe1ad9-47b4-4658-ada0-f923048deb67-3
00:34:06.936 --> 00:34:11.001
here. And if the machines in an
unhealthy state, you'll see red

68fe1ad9-47b4-4658-ada0-f923048deb67-4
00:34:11.001 --> 00:34:12.780
in this watchdog properties.

88fbce19-3e22-45b6-b2ff-6a249c203bfd-0
00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:17.078
And so that'll give you a clue
into what's going on and then

88fbce19-3e22-45b6-b2ff-6a249c203bfd-1
00:34:17.078 --> 00:34:17.900
repair audits.

bee7c0d3-c3a2-420e-a6be-af09021cdaf2-0
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:24.455
This is where you can see all of
the stuff that autopilot has

bee7c0d3-c3a2-420e-a6be-af09021cdaf2-1
00:34:24.455 --> 00:34:27.290
been doing so we can see that on
the 8th.

80f60216-8071-41b5-ae69-14ef5a0c3dd8-0
00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:31.370
It did an OS upgrade, so apply
to Windows Update.

4c56af01-ffa4-4fd3-8941-bd685ceca8d5-0
00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:33.830
And then.

3e170d7d-11ab-4e8f-bd94-873d9674178b-0
00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:40.369
Looks like it had tried to do an
OS upgrade a couple of times,

3e170d7d-11ab-4e8f-bd94-873d9674178b-1
00:34:40.369 --> 00:34:44.787
maybe failed the first try
succeeded the second try and

3e170d7d-11ab-4e8f-bd94-873d9674178b-2
00:34:44.787 --> 00:34:49.835
then did an app roll out to get
us caught up again and then the

3e170d7d-11ab-4e8f-bd94-873d9674178b-3
00:34:49.835 --> 00:34:52.360
other place I go quite often is.

95c77e0e-317b-46a9-8d57-358fc668da48-0
00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:56.490
Like I'll double click on a
machine here.

0a91a779-c3d2-4595-970c-a98ae0ea5893-0
00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.650
I'll double click on local logs.

759d74c9-7ec8-421f-a8ae-36c4ca281a1a-0
00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:12.245
And then go up here to filter
logs and go DSMS dash and we can

759d74c9-7ec8-421f-a8ae-36c4ca281a1a-1
00:35:12.245 --> 00:35:17.801
see all of our DSMS logs and so
you know how we in the code we

759d74c9-7ec8-421f-a8ae-36c4ca281a1a-2
00:35:17.801 --> 00:35:23.092
would do this trace to AP and
ifx. So Ifx is going into say

759d74c9-7ec8-421f-a8ae-36c4ca281a1a-3
00:35:23.092 --> 00:35:28.736
kusto AP is going directly onto
the machine and we can actually

759d74c9-7ec8-421f-a8ae-36c4ca281a1a-4
00:35:28.736 --> 00:35:30.500
look at the AP logs.

5c9f56fc-5214-4814-9ce7-793212617f01-0
00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:31.960
So.

e7e5ab58-3e4c-46ea-8ba0-4865242aceac-0
00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:38.652
You know, if you're trying to
figure out what's going wrong

e7e5ab58-3e4c-46ea-8ba0-4865242aceac-1
00:35:38.652 --> 00:35:42.588
with a specific machine, this is
often a a more convenient place

e7e5ab58-3e4c-46ea-8ba0-4865242aceac-2
00:35:42.588 --> 00:35:46.282
to go than Cousteau. But we
logged to both because sometimes

e7e5ab58-3e4c-46ea-8ba0-4865242aceac-3
00:35:46.282 --> 00:35:50.036
you're in Cousteau and you wanna
look at stuff going on on 10

e7e5ab58-3e4c-46ea-8ba0-4865242aceac-4
00:35:50.036 --> 00:35:53.547
different machines and so
whatever is the most useful for

e7e5ab58-3e4c-46ea-8ba0-4865242aceac-5
00:35:53.547 --> 00:35:53.790
you.

dae86e40-4870-40d4-9f65-2c2d3357c411-0
00:35:55.960 --> 00:36:01.080
I don't find myself using this
pain a lot we've got.

b0db737a-889c-4bfe-a6b4-9ec0a266b5e2-0
00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:07.898
Better dashboards for that.
Trying to think what else is a

b0db737a-889c-4bfe-a6b4-9ec0a266b5e2-1
00:36:07.898 --> 00:36:09.710
good quick thing to look at.

61745498-b6de-4abe-b062-ad0e42a89f53-0
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:13.200
Ohh you can also browse the file
system.

a3d2e78a-59b1-4fdc-88f5-b423410b7bff-0
00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:19.003
So any autopilot or pilot fish
machine go under the file

a3d2e78a-59b1-4fdc-88f5-b423410b7bff-1
00:36:19.003 --> 00:36:19.500
system.

44dc1e85-0de8-4764-870a-c6a2262fd6d5-0
00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:24.477
This is all going to be on the D
drive that we you can't browse

44dc1e85-0de8-4764-870a-c6a2262fd6d5-1
00:36:24.477 --> 00:36:28.236
the Windows folder on C drive.
Why would you want to? You

44dc1e85-0de8-4764-870a-c6a2262fd6d5-2
00:36:28.236 --> 00:36:32.060
should never want to. App is
where all of our services go.

84bccab4-a64a-43c4-9e06-09a600325b6c-0
00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:35.940
So for instance.

b1871183-ef9a-4bc6-b6dd-d616e7083836-0
00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:43.150
We can see some some DSMS stuff.

71b0892d-c949-4799-b15a-d845de5936dc-0
00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:46.040
Right. So this is where all the
binaries are going to go.

8b73a182-076e-41c5-9977-59448423f790-0
00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:47.760
UM.

a19c4e6f-d3b8-4503-8a22-56a693405bb9-0
00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:53.040
And then data.

fe48f311-3105-4164-bc3d-6116f30026da-0
00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:57.848
It's pretty self-explanatory.
It's very we're various data

fe48f311-3105-4164-bc3d-6116f30026da-1
00:36:57.848 --> 00:37:00.866
folders go and so there's gonna
be stuff written by our

fe48f311-3105-4164-bc3d-6116f30026da-2
00:37:00.866 --> 00:37:03.991
applications and then also stuff
written by the autopilot

fe48f311-3105-4164-bc3d-6116f30026da-3
00:37:03.991 --> 00:37:04.530
framework.

e05bab60-1666-4ccf-ac32-68b74d1af6f6-0
00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:08.970
So. So what I've shown you is.

d1b4384f-491c-4aed-a089-efadf792ca40-0
00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:13.160
80% of.

dd98c52f-01f4-42e3-820f-e5ba18c393de-0
00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:16.190
What you're gonna be doing
inside of? Uh.

4653e50f-cccf-4ab3-b6d4-0cccedfc8611-0
00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:19.867
XTS if you if you're
troubleshooting what's going on

4653e50f-cccf-4ab3-b6d4-0cccedfc8611-1
00:37:19.867 --> 00:37:23.181
in environment, cut the other
most often used thing is VE

4653e50f-cccf-4ab3-b6d4-0cccedfc8611-2
00:37:23.181 --> 00:37:23.810
deployment.

4d086a60-6bb1-45a9-8920-34c35dfc6081-0
00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.350
So someday you'll be running a
release.

e8c202f4-cda8-490d-92df-fa423e7ec41a-0
00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.120
And you'll come here.

b83b5d3d-5432-4360-b5bc-1dd34e9ac18d-0
00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:40.967
And click on the app deployment
page and you'll use this to

b83b5d3d-5432-4360-b5bc-1dd34e9ac18d-1
00:37:40.967 --> 00:37:45.284
manage our staging, right? We
don't blast out everything to

b83b5d3d-5432-4360-b5bc-1dd34e9ac18d-2
00:37:45.284 --> 00:37:46.219
one place we.

ef92d9f5-fafb-447f-aec1-210c36d2edb2-0
00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:50.882
Sort of. You know, slowly expand
the scope. So we we you send it

ef92d9f5-fafb-447f-aec1-210c36d2edb2-1
00:37:50.882 --> 00:37:54.626
to a test environment and then
to a stage environment then to a

ef92d9f5-fafb-447f-aec1-210c36d2edb2-2
00:37:54.626 --> 00:37:58.136
Canary environment and then to
low traffic regions and then

ef92d9f5-fafb-447f-aec1-210c36d2edb2-3
00:37:58.136 --> 00:38:01.822
medium traffic regions and then
the right, that's where all of

ef92d9f5-fafb-447f-aec1-210c36d2edb2-4
00:38:01.822 --> 00:38:05.449
this is managed. And so you can
see how the stages are going.

ef92d9f5-fafb-447f-aec1-210c36d2edb2-5
00:38:05.449 --> 00:38:09.018
Did we get stuck anywhere? Did
we roll back or if this is an

ef92d9f5-fafb-447f-aec1-210c36d2edb2-6
00:38:09.018 --> 00:38:12.470
emergency thing today, Danny's
doing an emergency hot fix.

6fbd6cf5-244d-450a-b9ec-29dae47835aa-0
00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:13.730
Umm.

58196429-5e62-4c51-8f23-a09d6bfa836b-0
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:18.597
You know, so he might come in
here and go. Oh no, no. This

58196429-5e62-4c51-8f23-a09d6bfa836b-1
00:38:18.597 --> 00:38:21.984
needs to go out to this region
now, right. So you might

58196429-5e62-4c51-8f23-a09d6bfa836b-2
00:38:21.984 --> 00:38:24.040
override our whole staging
logic.

e093ad1a-20f6-422a-8ec7-ca99fd8fa05e-0
00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:28.423
You can if you need to, you
shouldn't, but so. So that's the

e093ad1a-20f6-422a-8ec7-ca99fd8fa05e-1
00:38:28.423 --> 00:38:30.627
that this is the other, you
know, really common place.

e093ad1a-20f6-422a-8ec7-ca99fd8fa05e-2
00:38:30.627 --> 00:38:32.470
There's a whole bunch of other
views up here.

62921c05-6aad-47a6-9ab4-3518088c94b5-0
00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:38.137
Uh, there's a lot of stuff
that's specific to one service

62921c05-6aad-47a6-9ab4-3518088c94b5-1
00:38:38.137 --> 00:38:40.610
or another that not really
useful to us.

941fc571-d2c5-473c-a7ce-f14b3c733651-0
00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:43.080
But uh.

35491e19-2a58-4a0c-9d62-8b1ff804bab9-0
00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:46.670
I'm always finding out about new
ones.

d81a5df1-972b-4cd1-9625-e3a875f3d10d-0
00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:51.310
But the ones I've shown you just
now are the the ones you're

d81a5df1-972b-4cd1-9625-e3a875f3d10d-1
00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:52.510
gonna look at every day.

861841e8-8fa2-40a9-9cb4-aae9b73dbdc8-0
00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:55.940
Yeah. OK.

95b759f6-3eb8-4bba-a46b-ab1a9e7be85d-0
00:38:57.810 --> 00:39:01.287
In the Navigation Pane, so the
first tab is environments. Can

95b759f6-3eb8-4bba-a46b-ab1a9e7be85d-1
00:39:01.287 --> 00:39:04.708
you just walk me through that?
So if you go to environments,

95b759f6-3eb8-4bba-a46b-ab1a9e7be85d-2
00:39:04.708 --> 00:39:07.904
we'll see a bunch of different
environments, OK. So it's

95b759f6-3eb8-4bba-a46b-ab1a9e7be85d-3
00:39:07.904 --> 00:39:11.437
filtered by one, you filtered,
you picked it up from some ini,

95b759f6-3eb8-4bba-a46b-ab1a9e7be85d-4
00:39:11.437 --> 00:39:14.971
OK. And you went inside it and
there were a bunch of different

95b759f6-3eb8-4bba-a46b-ab1a9e7be85d-5
00:39:14.971 --> 00:39:18.336
services matching from that.
Those square bracket services.

95b759f6-3eb8-4bba-a46b-ab1a9e7be85d-6
00:39:18.336 --> 00:39:21.476
So these are these are the
machines. These are actually

95b759f6-3eb8-4bba-a46b-ab1a9e7be85d-7
00:39:21.476 --> 00:39:23.720
each of these are the physical
machine.

4965ee52-bc75-40ff-a87c-e16bae92a7d7-0
00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:29.342
And then each of these machines
as services running on it. Yeah.

4965ee52-bc75-40ff-a87c-e16bae92a7d7-1
00:39:29.342 --> 00:39:30.090
Yeah, they do.

0475d8ee-a08c-491a-a232-c9e8550d427c-0
00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:36.630
Tab or SQL OK and they have
logical IP S. OK, gotcha. OK.

99f448fe-89e7-4041-a221-9823f3ac2f79-0
00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:42.350
Yeah. OK. And so when when?

8d5acde5-c9c0-415a-b7b4-0b61c9ee8273-0
00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:47.966
When do you use XT as the most?
When you are on call or like

8d5acde5-c9c0-415a-b7b4-0b61c9ee8273-1
00:39:47.966 --> 00:39:48.610
every day?

291ffbf6-c12f-4d89-84cc-e05d922206ee-0
00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:54.530
Umm, you know, on call you spend
all your time in here?

d317853c-b05d-4987-88f3-a5cdd08e141e-0
00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:59.770
You know, because this is also
your jumping off point for like.

a14bf1b5-26b6-451c-ada1-0bc3c3657fea-0
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:04.481
Doing our opening up a remote
desktop session so I can show

a14bf1b5-26b6-451c-ada1-0bc3c3657fea-1
00:40:04.481 --> 00:40:07.650
you what that looks like. I've
been doing a lot of that lately,

a14bf1b5-26b6-451c-ada1-0bc3c3657fea-2
00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:09.780
so let me go ahead and close
this session.

cfac3a11-88f1-48f0-aaf6-45241b3839a9-0
00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.060
And I will reshare.

e0c5f243-d14f-43d0-9d48-2b68de087f01-0
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:19.560
On my saw.

b95077e1-7bf8-4c78-9add-f0485f657f04-0
00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:35.566
Yeah. So the only time I really
come in here is like during live

b95077e1-7bf8-4c78-9add-f0485f657f04-1
00:40:35.566 --> 00:40:38.520
site stuff where it's like, OK,
you need to go to the machine.

77ed655c-1747-4d4e-b2f1-7a94c96a067a-0
00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:42.350
To see what's wrong, right? So I
mean.

76c1182f-db6c-42c6-9d83-956828785d6e-0
00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:46.677
Sometimes it'll be the customer
saying, hey, I, you know, blah,

76c1182f-db6c-42c6-9d83-956828785d6e-1
00:40:46.677 --> 00:40:49.884
blah blah is not working for me.
And then you're probably just

76c1182f-db6c-42c6-9d83-956828785d6e-2
00:40:49.884 --> 00:40:53.040
gonna be helping them with the
SMS client commands and things

76c1182f-db6c-42c6-9d83-956828785d6e-3
00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:56.297
like that. And looking at their
data via kusto. But then if you

76c1182f-db6c-42c6-9d83-956828785d6e-4
00:40:56.297 --> 00:40:58.690
get something says, hey, this
machine is dead.

25c06d40-1d9b-47b4-a3d5-b877e3a5f2da-0
00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:01.240
You. You come here to fix it.

f40c9b63-3a86-4b55-9c61-526310a7bcdd-0
00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:04.010
And so for example.

2b2b1737-269f-4c7c-a255-df148cac94dc-0
00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:08.999
Let's see. I'm just gonna find
one of the machines I've been

2b2b1737-269f-4c7c-a255-df148cac94dc-1
00:41:08.999 --> 00:41:09.890
messing with here.

29c23c44-ce45-45c5-851f-d804621dd87b-0
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:17.370
Where is that? Here we go.

8fea377d-f0ff-4408-87a1-70ff3c900b30-0
00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:27.125
I'm just fine. I'm. I'm just
finding an environment that I

8fea377d-f0ff-4408-87a1-70ff3c900b30-1
00:41:27.125 --> 00:41:30.435
had to mess with earlier today.
Umm, I'll show you what it looks

8fea377d-f0ff-4408-87a1-70ff3c900b30-2
00:41:30.435 --> 00:41:31.200
like to log in.

1787c04a-0341-4036-af16-d556be184d49-0
00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:46.650
So I wanted to go here, so I
double click.

a41d6b6c-93f6-46ca-a50a-01ad99c3d9dd-0
00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:50.940
And now let's say if I want to
remote desktop to a machine.

4f332990-ae5a-4ffc-9d71-0e20c4e27ede-0
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:55.660
So I figured I found out this
guy's unhappy. I right click.

ac7ddb33-77c5-4e97-a8d4-480a64b3d871-0
00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:58.340
I would do request admin access.

b560cc05-7b03-4e77-8528-71be1b139fba-0
00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:10.288
Oh well, it's automatically
logging me in because I already

b560cc05-7b03-4e77-8528-71be1b139fba-1
00:42:10.288 --> 00:42:13.957
got admin access, but normally
this would open up a dialogue

b560cc05-7b03-4e77-8528-71be1b139fba-2
00:42:13.957 --> 00:42:15.160
window and it would.

bd455658-aef7-4608-ab68-8eefac3e44fc-0
00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.816
Set and create a jet request on
my behalf. Somebody would

bd455658-aef7-4608-ab68-8eefac3e44fc-1
00:42:20.816 --> 00:42:23.811
approve it and then I would
connect. So basically I've I've

bd455658-aef7-4608-ab68-8eefac3e44fc-2
00:42:23.811 --> 00:42:25.260
logged into the machine here.

dfc4fc6d-f233-498d-9078-951d12000c7e-0
00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:32.110
Well, and you'll see. Like if I
just open up Windows Explorer.

bebc5eb8-d3d5-4125-9f84-ccdf33a0174f-0
00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:34.730
I'll look on the D drive.

38ba7efc-9873-453e-ac0d-06f214033a31-0
00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:38.650
There's my app folder, there's
my data folder.

9b4bba68-c055-4279-b229-dcb71578905b-0
00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:47.120
Alright so.

a28bb5b7-5898-4c31-b6ff-3d4d812f9729-0
00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:51.010
Yeah.

643d361d-f861-48a8-ab71-dc686fe4a995-0
00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:52.510
OK.

37ec6d70-f23e-45ea-b2eb-e5f47d064d99-0
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.250
And like, do anything back.

a41c9d96-2063-4341-a33d-dd634998c1c9-0
00:42:58.470 --> 00:43:02.521
So in a couple of minutes back,
you were saying you'll go to

a41c9d96-2063-4341-a33d-dd634998c1c9-1
00:43:02.521 --> 00:43:05.510
Costco and and check the logs
and stuff. Uh.

27fab928-e2f4-4047-b321-fe8be217956b-0
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:10.027
Like if if some customer is
saying that you know I got some

27fab928-e2f4-4047-b321-fe8be217956b-1
00:43:10.027 --> 00:43:13.053
troubles in this machine or
whatever. So so will you go to

27fab928-e2f4-4047-b321-fe8be217956b-2
00:43:13.053 --> 00:43:16.335
coast gusto in that scenario as
well because it's gonna pull up

27fab928-e2f4-4047-b321-fe8be217956b-3
00:43:16.335 --> 00:43:19.207
the logs from a bunch of
different machines. Yeah. So I

27fab928-e2f4-4047-b321-fe8be217956b-4
00:43:19.207 --> 00:43:20.489
mean it's it's kind of a.

907c9a0e-d594-4739-9361-066d9e095b0e-0
00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:26.673
So wherever the right tool for
the job is, right? So when I'm

907c9a0e-d594-4739-9361-066d9e095b0e-1
00:43:26.673 --> 00:43:31.394
helping customers, I'm typically
gonna be either inside of DSMS

907c9a0e-d594-4739-9361-066d9e095b0e-2
00:43:31.394 --> 00:43:34.640
client on my saw machine going.
Hey, let's.

855bff07-54a8-462c-802e-bb7f5b868948-0
00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:39.283
Let's look at your secret.
What's going on here? Or I'm

855bff07-54a8-462c-802e-bb7f5b868948-1
00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:43.176
gonna be? Or if they're saying,
hey, the the blah, blah blah

855bff07-54a8-462c-802e-bb7f5b868948-2
00:43:43.176 --> 00:43:47.070
call fails whenever I try and
rotate the certificate, I get.

56e3a886-c476-4a04-8e01-68b5b172d2d5-0
00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:51.220
You know 500 or something,
right? And then that one I

56e3a886-c476-4a04-8e01-68b5b172d2d5-1
00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:54.860
probably go to kusto because
we've got 10 front end machines.

d3e4fa05-f8e1-44c8-975f-987afaee71ea-0
00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.322
Who knows which front end
machine it hit that got the 500,

d3e4fa05-f8e1-44c8-975f-987afaee71ea-1
00:44:00.322 --> 00:44:05.011
so I would go into Cousteau and
I would form the query that OK,

d3e4fa05-f8e1-44c8-975f-987afaee71ea-2
00:44:05.011 --> 00:44:09.554
what's the name of your secret?
OK API called event where URL

d3e4fa05-f8e1-44c8-975f-987afaee71ea-3
00:44:09.554 --> 00:44:10.580
path contains.

dd7f3dc5-6ebf-4f1e-a0fa-95e4eeaddc7b-0
00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:12.850
This guy's secret name.

ea0665c5-816a-45eb-b987-640c9ec81764-0
00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:14.670
Within the last.

bf8fa33d-ba99-4943-a943-00516cd534bb-0
00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:20.715
Day where status code equals
500, right? And then that will

bf8fa33d-ba99-4943-a943-00516cd534bb-1
00:44:20.715 --> 00:44:21.510
get that.

967f30b0-cbc4-4580-a0d0-6e8730182b05-0
00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:26.272
It won't matter what front end
machine processed that call.

967f30b0-cbc4-4580-a0d0-6e8730182b05-1
00:44:26.272 --> 00:44:27.600
We'll see it, right?

fba185aa-edac-48f4-b673-073b2976a109-0
00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:34.050
So and then there's also the
kusto has like.

eb17e7a8-240f-481d-b279-cac8ffb29c47-0
00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:39.100
As a snapshot of customer
secrets and stuff. So.

a1614521-074e-4f77-8fda-6a4afcc542d4-0
00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:45.999
Customer facing stuff. I'll
typically be in in kusto, DSS

a1614521-074e-4f77-8fda-6a4afcc542d4-1
00:44:45.999 --> 00:44:47.570
client low level like.

30b2a437-41a8-4790-bde6-658bc6161d32-0
00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:52.031
The service is unhealthy, but
the customer probably doesn't

30b2a437-41a8-4790-bde6-658bc6161d32-1
00:44:52.031 --> 00:44:53.810
know any better. I'm in XTS.

0d3455a1-9c88-4fd3-a419-598ceaeb8aa2-0
00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:57.080
Full on outage. I'm in XTS.

01cd8a22-e92b-4182-b956-ff1d8ba35688-0
00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:58.940
So yeah.

f398f9df-238d-4bd8-a7a2-217d69da99ed-0
00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:00.290
OK.

dc82db4c-ab4b-419b-8187-f88ed2a9a948-0
00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:04.316
Yeah, but outage has never
happened, right? So you'll be

dc82db4c-ab4b-419b-8187-f88ed2a9a948-1
00:45:04.316 --> 00:45:04.600
fine.

fd68a43d-0049-48ad-8a95-444f7c258909-0
00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:08.200
OK.

c05a7ec3-1519-4158-9e71-1366d2235743-0
00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:14.312
Yeah, so so next steps for me.
I'm gonna. I'm gonna play around

c05a7ec3-1519-4158-9e71-1366d2235743-1
00:45:14.312 --> 00:45:17.510
with UH-1 box, and I'm gonna try
to run.

d40707d6-2b82-4610-a00e-5da5d318a8aa-0
00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:22.751
Or like distribution package or
service and try to look up the

d40707d6-2b82-4610-a00e-5da5d318a8aa-1
00:45:22.751 --> 00:45:26.495
logs at in store everything is
happening or not awesome and

d40707d6-2b82-4610-a00e-5da5d318a8aa-2
00:45:26.495 --> 00:45:27.120
really do.

35b53770-f8ef-4a64-b51e-11944906da2f-0
00:45:27.830 --> 00:45:31.319
You know, take notes and if
there's anything that's unclear

35b53770-f8ef-4a64-b51e-11944906da2f-1
00:45:31.319 --> 00:45:33.820
or difficult about the one box
experience.

ca0ba195-585c-42b1-8fd5-46cb22f46c73-0
00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:40.507
You know, write it down and fire
off emails to like the DS.

ca0ba195-585c-42b1-8fd5-46cb22f46c73-1
00:45:40.507 --> 00:45:41.360
MSFT's UM.

58a06c7c-88cb-4d7a-9d46-32431dc3244b-0
00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:46.876
You know, because we really do
want it to just become an

58a06c7c-88cb-4d7a-9d46-32431dc3244b-1
00:45:46.876 --> 00:45:50.060
automatic hands free thing for
sure so.

401ba5b6-51b3-4913-80fc-1d48372cc2f8-0
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.360
Def. Definitely uh.

d26155bc-8426-4fe9-ba70-8459e47cdbc4-0
00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:56.741
Sure. Yeah. No, don't. Don't
bang your head on the wall for

d26155bc-8426-4fe9-ba70-8459e47cdbc4-1
00:45:56.741 --> 00:45:59.988
half a day and think that the
problem is you. The problems

d26155bc-8426-4fe9-ba70-8459e47cdbc4-2
00:45:59.988 --> 00:46:03.290
with the one box tool and it
needs to just be bullet proof.

169b88f8-244c-4def-9f42-30e3347160f0-0
00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:09.469
Yeah, I I yeah. I was just doing
1 box stuff today because like

169b88f8-244c-4def-9f42-30e3347160f0-1
00:46:09.469 --> 00:46:14.169
when I started like a month or
something and I was trying to do

169b88f8-244c-4def-9f42-30e3347160f0-2
00:46:14.169 --> 00:46:18.795
1 box, it wasn't working for me.
And then I started again this

169b88f8-244c-4def-9f42-30e3347160f0-3
00:46:18.795 --> 00:46:22.834
morning and I I had a bit of
luck today like if things

169b88f8-244c-4def-9f42-30e3347160f0-4
00:46:22.834 --> 00:46:26.799
worked. But so there's a there's
a looks I I kind of.

4d19bd3f-74f0-4242-a93b-c5815ff895d3-0
00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:31.194
Made a blunder or something on
Friday like my whole machine

4d19bd3f-74f0-4242-a93b-c5815ff895d3-1
00:46:31.194 --> 00:46:34.644
was, uh, you know, resetted and
and I had to like my whole C

4d19bd3f-74f0-4242-a93b-c5815ff895d3-2
00:46:34.644 --> 00:46:38.151
program files that folder was
gone like with sticky notes and

4d19bd3f-74f0-4242-a93b-c5815ff895d3-3
00:46:38.151 --> 00:46:41.546
every kind of stuff like every
software I had installed. So

4d19bd3f-74f0-4242-a93b-c5815ff895d3-4
00:46:41.546 --> 00:46:43.129
because there was something.

e54688dc-a8a9-45a4-8390-bc573928a7b6-0
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:48.987
Uh, so I was trying to enlist to
PF gold. Uh on Friday and uh,

e54688dc-a8a9-45a4-8390-bc573928a7b6-1
00:46:48.987 --> 00:46:53.671
when I was trying to do that it
it kept giving me some weird

e54688dc-a8a9-45a4-8390-bc573928a7b6-2
00:46:53.671 --> 00:46:58.048
errors saying username not
authorized or something. So I

e54688dc-a8a9-45a4-8390-bc573928a7b6-3
00:46:58.048 --> 00:47:01.119
looked up that error on Stack
Overflow.

c9b4a102-b5b8-4e84-8653-52a76c0ec2a9-0
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:05.941
Internal Stack overflow and
someone said it so that your

c9b4a102-b5b8-4e84-8653-52a76c0ec2a9-1
00:47:05.941 --> 00:47:09.690
next stop is probably not set up
correctly. You need to change

c9b4a102-b5b8-4e84-8653-52a76c0ec2a9-2
00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:13.558
the name of your machine to blah
blah blah just like your alias-

c9b4a102-b5b8-4e84-8653-52a76c0ec2a9-3
00:47:13.558 --> 00:47:17.247
something. So I did that and
like my whole stuff was gone and

c9b4a102-b5b8-4e84-8653-52a76c0ec2a9-4
00:47:17.247 --> 00:47:20.817
I was trying to redo things and
finally I got things up and

c9b4a102-b5b8-4e84-8653-52a76c0ec2a9-5
00:47:20.817 --> 00:47:24.268
running again OK. And that that
bug was resolved that the

c9b4a102-b5b8-4e84-8653-52a76c0ec2a9-6
00:47:24.268 --> 00:47:27.601
original bug and that's why I
started one box today and

c9b4a102-b5b8-4e84-8653-52a76c0ec2a9-7
00:47:27.601 --> 00:47:31.052
probably it was the same issue
with one box as well. Like

c9b4a102-b5b8-4e84-8653-52a76c0ec2a9-8
00:47:31.052 --> 00:47:32.540
earlier maybe yeah maybe.

d1bfb709-7a8c-46b3-9df8-4313d6b3e15f-0
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:35.916
And then and then also one
person who's been wrestling with

d1bfb709-7a8c-46b3-9df8-4313d6b3e15f-1
00:47:35.916 --> 00:47:37.340
it a lot is Michael Daria.

06e68a7c-8e41-40df-9721-b9583b03d028-0
00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:41.929
He's the guy who actually shares
an office with me. I don't know

06e68a7c-8e41-40df-9721-b9583b03d028-1
00:47:41.929 --> 00:47:43.290
if you've met. Yeah. Yeah, I.

f3ba14aa-e6a2-42e1-8521-dc328795143b-0
00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:44.870
And uh.

1b14e65a-df65-4e8b-bfcd-4e0397b7886f-0
00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:50.903
Yeah, he's he. He's been trying
to get into end testing, going

1b14e65a-df65-4e8b-bfcd-4e0397b7886f-1
00:47:50.903 --> 00:47:54.478
for the SDP project, so he might
be able to give you some

1b14e65a-df65-4e8b-bfcd-4e0397b7886f-2
00:47:54.478 --> 00:47:55.280
pointers but.

30bcba07-0576-4ff1-ad30-39ae3ff248dd-0
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:59.882
Yeah. So The thing is like I, I
I don't know if you ever tried

30bcba07-0576-4ff1-ad30-39ae3ff248dd-1
00:47:59.882 --> 00:48:03.209
like 1 box stuff. So, so I uh,
so there's a step, there's a

30bcba07-0576-4ff1-ad30-39ae3ff248dd-2
00:48:03.209 --> 00:48:06.369
bunch of documents I was
following and there's a step to

30bcba07-0576-4ff1-ad30-39ae3ff248dd-3
00:48:06.369 --> 00:48:09.862
run build, validation test. I
don't know what test these tests

30bcba07-0576-4ff1-ad30-39ae3ff248dd-4
00:48:09.862 --> 00:48:13.299
are, but every each of them was
failing. So I talked to Diana

30bcba07-0576-4ff1-ad30-39ae3ff248dd-5
00:48:13.299 --> 00:48:16.848
about this and like apparently
that those tests are failing for

30bcba07-0576-4ff1-ad30-39ae3ff248dd-6
00:48:16.848 --> 00:48:20.340
everyone. I mean no one got that
running. So I don't know what

30bcba07-0576-4ff1-ad30-39ae3ff248dd-7
00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:23.722
the issue is, but I'm going to
make the notes and point like

30bcba07-0576-4ff1-ad30-39ae3ff248dd-8
00:48:23.722 --> 00:48:23.999
make.

92da070e-d9fa-4a52-bee9-83abda753c11-0
00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:28.862
Note these things. I'm gonna
revisit them and yeah, I will

92da070e-d9fa-4a52-bee9-83abda753c11-1
00:48:28.862 --> 00:48:29.470
follow up.

11f6cfe9-7f0d-4e7d-9934-9464b0b785e7-0
00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:31.860
OK, cool. Yeah.

b1d3841b-76c7-4607-b80d-73aa71028c9c-0
00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:37.512
Yeah, like the situation we were
in before the one box got

b1d3841b-76c7-4607-b80d-73aa71028c9c-1
00:48:37.512 --> 00:48:38.480
rewritten was like.

3bf6d34f-25e3-4ddb-8809-0aeb79539b1a-0
00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:41.050
For half the team.

4212f475-9f48-48e0-9481-02ccdbaae8fc-0
00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:45.993
Could get it working. It works
on their dev machines but on

4212f475-9f48-48e0-9481-02ccdbaae8fc-1
00:48:45.993 --> 00:48:49.030
nobody elses and nobody
remembered why it's so they

4212f475-9f48-48e0-9481-02ccdbaae8fc-2
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:52.300
didn't know how to help the
people that were broken so.

2ba26075-f754-48ce-9c9f-45aa32629f86-0
00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:58.710
And I and I think it was like
some certificate leftover from.

26f965f6-0e79-4baf-8ea7-aabbb3327ca3-0
00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:03.967
The original Secret store
application, which has now been

26f965f6-0e79-4baf-8ea7-aabbb3327ca3-1
00:49:03.967 --> 00:49:08.576
deprecated, but the DSMS used to
bootstrap off of or something.

26f965f6-0e79-4baf-8ea7-aabbb3327ca3-2
00:49:08.576 --> 00:49:13.113
And like I'm still getting some
errors, but I think they might

26f965f6-0e79-4baf-8ea7-aabbb3327ca3-3
00:49:13.113 --> 00:49:17.578
be they might not be too harmful
and OK to proceed, but yeah,

26f965f6-0e79-4baf-8ea7-aabbb3327ca3-4
00:49:17.578 --> 00:49:21.179
I'll find it out. Yeah. And one
last thing, Jeff.

0daaf765-888e-42ca-b03d-a8014ed4f15c-0
00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:27.058
So so when you're talking about
developer environment like Dev,

0daaf765-888e-42ca-b03d-a8014ed4f15c-1
00:49:27.058 --> 00:49:29.140
two machine or whatever. So uh.

28c35397-fc9e-4893-81a6-da1f4d25ce61-0
00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:33.164
So I remember the PPF gold
thing. So do we need to make

28c35397-fc9e-4893-81a6-da1f4d25ce61-1
00:49:33.164 --> 00:49:36.535
changes in that repository or
use those functionalities when

28c35397-fc9e-4893-81a6-da1f4d25ce61-2
00:49:36.535 --> 00:49:39.685
we are trying to deploy on
Canary node or any production

28c35397-fc9e-4893-81a6-da1f4d25ce61-3
00:49:39.685 --> 00:49:43.167
level or developer environments?
Right now we've got four it's

28c35397-fc9e-4893-81a6-da1f4d25ce61-4
00:49:43.167 --> 00:49:45.819
developer 1, developer 2
developer 3 developer.

f81d8948-fce0-4f4f-bbfb-b4f52941818f-0
00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:49.530
And those are full on.

b15c355e-d515-4ab0-81b2-cca39aa77a6c-0
00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:53.750
Production like topologies.

92ca91ee-36d5-4603-a989-e1203771acac-0
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:59.613
They they are, you know,
complete environments, you know,

92ca91ee-36d5-4603-a989-e1203771acac-1
00:49:59.613 --> 00:50:01.520
in and of themselves and.

6bf6f720-0caa-4ff7-9698-c5b64308a39a-0
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:05.220
But to deploy to them you use
that.

791be756-54f4-4184-852c-e5ef1a7c4f28-0
00:50:06.590 --> 00:50:10.407
That pipeline that I was showing
you earlier, we've it's it's not

791be756-54f4-4184-852c-e5ef1a7c4f28-1
00:50:10.407 --> 00:50:13.010
like doing a production
deployment where we.

a07ca9f8-9109-4cc5-b15e-dc66013022ea-0
00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:19.114
Updated deployment ini file and
there's a a code review and all

a07ca9f8-9109-4cc5-b15e-dc66013022ea-1
00:50:19.114 --> 00:50:20.190
that for the.

f348d3c9-a59a-4278-a077-0b9b59e49fcb-0
00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:25.369
Developer pipelines. We've tried
to streamline it a little bit so

f348d3c9-a59a-4278-a077-0b9b59e49fcb-1
00:50:25.369 --> 00:50:28.610
you can just go to the the
website and say create a new

f348d3c9-a59a-4278-a077-0b9b59e49fcb-2
00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:31.620
build and it should go pick it
up from anywhere so.

1c698a7e-4156-41df-b921-378aa5c00bb2-0
00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:36.570
So PF goal is specifically meant
for production level deployments

1c698a7e-4156-41df-b921-378aa5c00bb2-1
00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:40.169
and those now everything's PPF
gold, right? Even the developer

1c698a7e-4156-41df-b921-378aa5c00bb2-2
00:50:40.169 --> 00:50:41.540
machines are in PF gold.

6d4161ed-4d80-41ad-85b2-1ea46d48907e-0
00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:45.918
Where does? Yeah, streamlined
little bit like why are you guys

6d4161ed-4d80-41ad-85b2-1ea46d48907e-1
00:50:45.918 --> 00:50:46.260
right?

c16d203a-90d9-47c3-adb8-1284764a9b91-0
00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:51.862
If I want to deploy something on
Karen Canary or production then

c16d203a-90d9-47c3-adb8-1284764a9b91-1
00:50:51.862 --> 00:50:55.855
I need to interfere with PF gold
actually like that, right? Yeah.

c16d203a-90d9-47c3-adb8-1284764a9b91-2
00:50:55.855 --> 00:50:59.606
We have like a deployment.in I
file where we say this maps to

c16d203a-90d9-47c3-adb8-1284764a9b91-3
00:50:59.606 --> 00:51:03.297
this. This maps to that and
there are ways to integrate that

c16d203a-90d9-47c3-adb8-1284764a9b91-4
00:51:03.297 --> 00:51:03.600
with.

be5a9645-f7e1-4f53-9f60-e899e82ff2dc-0
00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:07.882
Some of the modern you know, Web
UI build pipelines, just like we

be5a9645-f7e1-4f53-9f60-e899e82ff2dc-1
00:51:07.882 --> 00:51:09.790
did with the developer
environments.

3ae639b8-42d6-40bf-9e72-7698e8d2a598-0
00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:14.070
Right, OK. We just haven't.

feac8fc1-d990-4567-9364-d3994c08dda1-0
00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:18.714
You know, we're not deploying to
production that often. It's like

feac8fc1-d990-4567-9364-d3994c08dda1-1
00:51:18.714 --> 00:51:21.630
a once a month thing. It just
hasn't been a thing that we need

feac8fc1-d990-4567-9364-d3994c08dda1-2
00:51:21.630 --> 00:51:22.510
to optimize, right.

3257335f-75df-4a08-ae2a-f877421e1c7d-0
00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:28.023
And and can you explain me in in
in single line the difference

3257335f-75df-4a08-ae2a-f877421e1c7d-1
00:51:28.023 --> 00:51:32.494
between PF cold and and sorry
the difference between pilot

3257335f-75df-4a08-ae2a-f877421e1c7d-2
00:51:32.494 --> 00:51:36.586
fish and autopilot like
autopilot is like a framework

3257335f-75df-4a08-ae2a-f877421e1c7d-3
00:51:36.586 --> 00:51:37.420
autopilots.

a9ac6750-7544-4873-b77f-38642b102a15-0
00:51:38.310 --> 00:51:41.570
Pilot fish is autopilot plus.

984b72c4-aed2-4acd-aa6b-cda6459cbab2-0
00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:47.270
A whole bunch more security and
compliance.

bb8a0741-6397-4d9e-be76-0ce8c088ef59-0
00:51:48.610 --> 00:51:51.760
OK, so we use it
interchangeably.

ff629f01-17c9-4f40-9917-c400164cc35e-0
00:51:53.570 --> 00:51:54.870
Yeah. So.

a7f2b795-33de-4cde-ad90-df64349b38a0-0
00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:57.520
Like.

4d2f512c-8602-43e0-bad0-8570f7e6865f-0
00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:00.230
If you have.

56d1ba6e-6132-4fb5-a5a7-5d5c893e8f6d-0
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:03.320
So, so so for example.

4957c442-5cd6-417e-97bc-1a5027df57dc-0
00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:10.628
You know, to to, to run
something inside of the US

4957c442-5cd6-417e-97bc-1a5027df57dc-1
00:52:10.628 --> 00:52:13.290
government. National cloud,
there's.

c4b1f918-e2ef-4040-9e2d-5a390fbee3e8-0
00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:19.031
Requirements you know about like
you know how the environment is

c4b1f918-e2ef-4040-9e2d-5a390fbee3e8-1
00:52:19.031 --> 00:52:23.249
managed, that autopilot doesn't
mean. So we had to put it into

c4b1f918-e2ef-4040-9e2d-5a390fbee3e8-2
00:52:23.249 --> 00:52:26.530
pilot fish. There is a place on
engineering hub.

cacead0a-5ed5-40b4-bd8a-cec774cecf37-0
00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:30.370
That goes into the details.

096fa399-d905-4c9b-8ad4-6dd416aad91f-0
00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:31.960
OK.

4f5ec525-45e1-4102-bc69-801da0127779-0
00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:38.980
Everything we do is in pilot
fish.

4f2d29bc-6fd2-4159-bac0-8309f928352b-0
00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:40.230
OK.

9e2b2e1a-89c2-4839-8d0f-8af47cc79e63-0
00:52:41.050 --> 00:52:45.473
Of ohh another big difference
between autopilot and pilot fish

9e2b2e1a-89c2-4839-8d0f-8af47cc79e63-1
00:52:45.473 --> 00:52:47.580
is pilot fish is domain lists.

9307b974-4720-47e1-a247-ea8f14112c78-0
00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:52.941
Where is Autopilot has a I think
it's PHX domain, although I

9307b974-4720-47e1-a247-ea8f14112c78-1
00:52:52.941 --> 00:52:55.270
think that that's changing but.

c8e1629e-9a76-4317-9c38-1bf9cdf54e7b-0
00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:38.424
Yeah, pilot fish has been
audited and is compliant with

c8e1629e-9a76-4317-9c38-1bf9cdf54e7b-1
00:53:38.424 --> 00:53:39.960
blah, blah, blah blah blah.

f5e8c929-a346-46c0-8f73-b7e735ae3882-0
00:53:41.130 --> 00:53:41.720
So.

ec305a2d-5d86-408e-9f75-764cc479f2c4-0
00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:44.180


3ae7d45c-545e-4d0c-b9a9-97a838d1cf1d-0
00:53:46.810 --> 00:53:48.240
I'll go ahead and put that in
chat.

6271d46e-0397-4c31-a501-45cb4eee42b2-0
00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:54.500
And there are some additional.

86944699-30e8-4cba-b8bc-ba9d7f17d3c1-0
00:53:56.050 --> 00:53:57.800
Process constraints about.

65483ddf-ce99-43f0-a389-34bd6b964cd7-0
00:53:58.540 --> 00:54:00.790
You know how we get stuff into
pilot fish?

596a81dc-c7ce-4120-8da2-dd43b9593e38-0
00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:02.790
So.

6f16bb94-c123-4c6a-aca7-3fb6f32054a4-0
00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:08.160
For example, any check in into
the pilot Fish control plane,

6f16bb94-c123-4c6a-aca7-3fb6f32054a4-1
00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:10.350
everything's got to be signed.

95023772-e903-4db3-8413-92c96684e27d-0
00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:14.791
There's, you know, code review
requirements and you know the

95023772-e903-4db3-8413-92c96684e27d-1
00:54:14.791 --> 00:54:15.270
way things.

d4af05b5-e426-4438-b9d6-72b4afe15884-0
00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:17.330
Uh, like that or done?

fc8bdd37-68c5-4c89-b2f0-6edd21d6dcec-0
00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:22.480
Just more more stringent than in
an AP classic.

22a4c3fe-29fe-4c2e-bfbd-641ecdbee640-0
00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:29.682
I have a feeling that's
everything is gonna be pilotfish

22a4c3fe-29fe-4c2e-bfbd-641ecdbee640-1
00:54:29.682 --> 00:54:30.990
eventually because.

20bcdf2d-057a-433b-8d2d-e91399fef3e4-0
00:54:33.930 --> 00:54:36.610
You know, so so many of the
things that we have to do.

38b37bb7-265a-4496-8101-5b8c5d7231c3-0
00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:41.573
Like if there's a really good
security requirement to meet on

38b37bb7-265a-4496-8101-5b8c5d7231c3-1
00:54:41.573 --> 00:54:45.090
pilot fish, why wouldn't we want
to meet it in autopilot, right?

94268f69-1008-48ee-b6e9-abf396ed9d0d-0
00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:52.207
But yeah, that that's just what
my gut tells me. I I don't know

94268f69-1008-48ee-b6e9-abf396ed9d0d-1
00:54:52.207 --> 00:54:53.820
that one way or the other so.

117ece9a-37f5-4d86-94cd-084babcc75da-0
00:55:00.490 --> 00:55:01.720
Yeah, sounds good.

fac4d72d-b8e2-467b-9f3a-ade28eff0bf7-0
00:55:05.570 --> 00:55:09.540
Can you send me this link as
well? OK, I'll read it. Yeah.

6eaf5383-0daf-4437-bef8-097bc035e0f7-0
00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:12.480
I'm just kind of reading it
myself because I.

cd887074-ea36-439f-b1ac-5b727f54710c-0
00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:15.800
I knew the generalities, but I
didn't. Uh.

236c29f3-19b0-4d54-b92f-c1090808e868-0
00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:18.920
Remember, a lot of the details.

6c758ff2-2a93-48e6-8ef4-9ade976aebe4-0
00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:25.460
This is a biggie.

279575aa-f172-4281-a41e-c4f3ca6e4df3-0
00:55:47.330 --> 00:55:48.140
Yeah. So.

16570532-72b9-44e3-b7ea-ed4621dd677e-0
00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:53.408
Yeah, but a lot of people will
use autopilot and pilot fish

16570532-72b9-44e3-b7ea-ed4621dd677e-1
00:55:53.408 --> 00:55:54.320
interchangeably.

46039f89-b8d7-4bc1-a906-e74fd25fb76b-0
00:55:55.070 --> 00:55:55.480
So.

6ecc7dc6-3a66-462a-8931-1b55d8b32af1-0
00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:56.690
OK.

eb67e062-a734-4a3d-97bd-23464d156c53-0
00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:02.890
Yeah, I.

362e4454-ea2c-4770-8d76-04275f634201-0
00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:09.060
Signing.

21799afb-853f-4d27-9fef-48abab63ba7b-0
00:56:14.530 --> 00:56:16.940
And I was also going through.

954e0054-8348-42a8-96c0-1925e273646b-0
00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:21.881
The the the design doc that you
shared with me. Yeah, I think it

954e0054-8348-42a8-96c0-1925e273646b-1
00:56:21.881 --> 00:56:25.622
is very well written. I mean a
lot of things made sense to me

954e0054-8348-42a8-96c0-1925e273646b-2
00:56:25.622 --> 00:56:29.303
and I was feeling like, yeah,
yeah, this is good. Thank you.

954e0054-8348-42a8-96c0-1925e273646b-3
00:56:29.303 --> 00:56:33.104
Yeah. The other scenarios and
everything, even though I didn't

954e0054-8348-42a8-96c0-1925e273646b-4
00:56:33.104 --> 00:56:36.905
cover a few lasts scenarios. But
yeah, like things were making

954e0054-8348-42a8-96c0-1925e273646b-5
00:56:36.905 --> 00:56:39.440
sense. What we're trying to
achieve here.

0fc64f54-d099-48ac-a2ef-4b6356307246-0
00:56:41.570 --> 00:56:44.746
Cool. Yeah, so hopefully I don't
know if you've looked at any of

0fc64f54-d099-48ac-a2ef-4b6356307246-1
00:56:44.746 --> 00:56:47.580
the original code, but the the
goal really is to make it.

f4d986d6-e62c-4927-8fa6-74e1e97e7e49-0
00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:55.490
Simpler uh Brazil code like I
tried. It's like it's difficult

f4d986d6-e62c-4927-8fa6-74e1e97e7e49-1
00:56:55.490 --> 00:56:59.400
to understand it. I was just
lost in that code.

9289fe82-c825-4518-ae5a-15990c0dae8f-0
00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:01.350
Yeah, and.

1f8beb7c-bda9-4160-9696-e6d61dcfe3c5-0
00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:03.590
Everybody is.

b1b92eb7-6b85-4290-b2fa-cd0f580b6f3d-0
00:57:04.770 --> 00:57:06.960
Because, well, I mean, what was
hard about it was.

1f430512-77e2-46c9-9fe5-e68946b8bf38-0
00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:11.441
It was written against the
original Imos database, which

1f430512-77e2-46c9-9fe5-e68946b8bf38-1
00:57:11.441 --> 00:57:14.490
was an in process in memory
database and so.

2166e4c4-7c43-4f98-962a-2cf777411872-0
00:57:18.090 --> 00:57:20.170
Any operation against?

5c1f564c-1c72-469c-b219-d4a0c975bf36-0
00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:26.690
A service that might have had
baking secrets, you had to know.

f0320e80-745c-4e06-94f3-0477968f8bd9-0
00:57:27.770 --> 00:57:30.874
About every other at any
operation that you did on a

f0320e80-745c-4e06-94f3-0477968f8bd9-1
00:57:30.874 --> 00:57:34.682
service object, you had to know
about every other operation that

f0320e80-745c-4e06-94f3-0477968f8bd9-2
00:57:34.682 --> 00:57:38.080
was currently in progress on the
service object and then.

206a0db2-3c4b-4742-bd85-a1130fe815c0-0
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:44.185
Ohh well what I just was just
what I'm trying to do renders

206a0db2-3c4b-4742-bd85-a1130fe815c0-1
00:57:44.185 --> 00:57:48.170
you know these two things
obviously. So I got just gotta

206a0db2-3c4b-4742-bd85-a1130fe815c0-2
00:57:48.170 --> 00:57:52.575
cancel that one. And this other
guy. I need to cancel them and

206a0db2-3c4b-4742-bd85-a1130fe815c0-3
00:57:52.575 --> 00:57:56.771
then restart him. But with my
new stuff added to it, right.

206a0db2-3c4b-4742-bd85-a1130fe815c0-4
00:57:56.771 --> 00:57:57.680
And then but.

80ef202e-4ba3-40d6-8d73-3acafb646ee9-0
00:57:59.110 --> 00:58:02.344
But then some other guy comes in
and he's he's he's doing that to

80ef202e-4ba3-40d6-8d73-3acafb646ee9-1
00:58:02.344 --> 00:58:05.382
your stuff. You're doing it to
their stuff, and it was just a

80ef202e-4ba3-40d6-8d73-3acafb646ee9-2
00:58:05.382 --> 00:58:06.020
mess. And UM.

ba1a3a6d-e404-4414-a9f3-ffbf852eeef2-0
00:58:07.530 --> 00:58:11.332
Then and we got a lot of bugs in
there. We've got performance

ba1a3a6d-e404-4414-a9f3-ffbf852eeef2-1
00:58:11.332 --> 00:58:15.380
issues, we've got business logic
errors. It's just a really hard.

4d6bef1b-44c5-46af-a575-199a4b5feb04-0
00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:20.210
It's just a lot of complexity
evolves that.

f11d41f6-e87d-4e90-9327-f4a1cb810dfc-0
00:58:22.410 --> 00:58:25.193
You know, we're just really
can't fix it in place. We just

f11d41f6-e87d-4e90-9327-f4a1cb810dfc-1
00:58:25.193 --> 00:58:27.080
have to rewrite the thing from
scratch.

96b12061-6d30-44ed-9eb2-af3a3850e525-0
00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:28.880
So.

ebf69a67-16d2-4c76-80e0-3f4ef0295fd6-0
00:58:29.630 --> 00:58:30.940
So you know definitely.

a0448df3-954a-4cbc-bfb8-ef131073e57e-0
00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:38.047
You know, always be thinking
like you know what's what's the

a0448df3-954a-4cbc-bfb8-ef131073e57e-1
00:58:38.047 --> 00:58:42.588
simplest possible way we can do
this? Uh, right. So yeah. And I

a0448df3-954a-4cbc-bfb8-ef131073e57e-2
00:58:42.588 --> 00:58:46.845
think in the document you use
the term SDPC secrets and non

a0448df3-954a-4cbc-bfb8-ef131073e57e-3
00:58:46.845 --> 00:58:51.030
SDC secrets. So is there a
bifurcation? Are there like two

a0448df3-954a-4cbc-bfb8-ef131073e57e-4
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:54.720
different kinds is a timing
thing right? So we are.

f7f931f4-d81b-4e13-9009-990cfaae2ed0-0
00:58:56.450 --> 00:58:59.692
So so First off there's there's
SDP in two senses of the word,

f7f931f4-d81b-4e13-9009-990cfaae2ed0-1
00:58:59.692 --> 00:59:01.030
right there's there's SDP.

31030310-9755-4f0b-861a-a44c6f4418cd-0
00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:06.117
For just in region and that's
what you and I are working on.

31030310-9755-4f0b-861a-a44c6f4418cd-1
00:59:06.117 --> 00:59:10.384
That's OK. This secret got
rotated and it's gonna go out to

31030310-9755-4f0b-861a-a44c6f4418cd-2
00:59:10.384 --> 00:59:14.936
these three Canary nodes for the
service and then it's gonna go

31030310-9755-4f0b-861a-a44c6f4418cd-3
00:59:14.936 --> 00:59:19.558
out to all the other nodes after
24 hours, right. So there's SDP

31030310-9755-4f0b-861a-a44c6f4418cd-4
00:59:19.558 --> 00:59:24.180
in that sense. And then there's
another SDP project in the works

31030310-9755-4f0b-861a-a44c6f4418cd-5
00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:28.590
that's mostly being run by the
Australia team and that's the.

190d67b0-24cf-41f7-ad45-ae564c4ba017-0
00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:37.409
Cross regional SDP so UM service
Foo has a presence in 10

190d67b0-24cf-41f7-ad45-ae564c4ba017-1
00:59:37.409 --> 00:59:40.360
different regions and.

4d2b79f1-0e2c-4859-8292-2258dba4cf87-0
00:59:43.790 --> 00:59:46.610
You know we're we're are right
now our our assist.

e5adbec4-e60a-4e4f-a8a2-53774abba75d-0
00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:50.913
System is a very eventually
consistent secrets for service

e5adbec4-e60a-4e4f-a8a2-53774abba75d-1
00:59:50.913 --> 00:59:54.365
food are, you know, being
rotated all over the place and

e5adbec4-e60a-4e4f-a8a2-53774abba75d-2
00:59:54.365 --> 00:59:58.060
distribution happy and all all
the time. And it's kind of a.

16c0d9d5-6498-4688-aa59-9614752c5d9f-0
00:59:58.740 --> 01:00:02.291
You know, just trust us. It's
eventually consistent, except

16c0d9d5-6498-4688-aa59-9614752c5d9f-1
01:00:02.291 --> 01:00:05.310
for when it's not sort of thing
and and customers.

b5c6019e-303f-4be9-99ee-174468871d56-0
01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:08.690
You know, they they wanna know.

defa4145-5423-4a5b-b54e-943417a7faea-0
01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:13.590
The state of their system in a
given time and they they want to

defa4145-5423-4a5b-b54e-943417a7faea-1
01:00:13.590 --> 01:00:17.359
know what it's what it is now
and what it's going to be in 24

defa4145-5423-4a5b-b54e-943417a7faea-2
01:00:17.359 --> 01:00:21.128
hours and and where did it break
down? Right. And things like

defa4145-5423-4a5b-b54e-943417a7faea-3
01:00:21.128 --> 01:00:24.532
that. So there's this SDP
project that is kind of doing

defa4145-5423-4a5b-b54e-943417a7faea-4
01:00:24.532 --> 01:00:28.544
what you and I are doing, right.
But in across regional state. So

defa4145-5423-4a5b-b54e-943417a7faea-5
01:00:28.544 --> 01:00:32.435
service food might have a thing
where says, OK, it's the 1st of

defa4145-5423-4a5b-b54e-943417a7faea-6
01:00:32.435 --> 01:00:32.800
March.

2e34928a-5b6e-469e-9853-118e9d113455-0
01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:37.710
Rotate all of the secrets for
service Foo and.

0bef21fe-1267-438d-97fe-9b36553d86e9-0
01:00:38.790 --> 01:00:40.670
And that'll all happen in.

47ab8786-1ee3-42a6-8f20-18f06e06e0f0-0
01:00:41.850 --> 01:00:43.260
Their region 1.

f8f99bf4-b1cc-448f-b689-f37e0d69df0c-0
01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:49.260
And then after three 4-5 days,
we'll the system will say, oh,

f8f99bf4-b1cc-448f-b689-f37e0d69df0c-1
01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:51.200
hey, everything for food.

1a13b2cc-1e98-4276-adf0-3cf1718c2e0a-0
01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:54.630
Came off without a hitch in
Region 1.

153c6ca1-916d-4012-b173-e11cd1819a62-0
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:58.100
Now let's do the same thing in
regions 2-3 and four.

7deaa3a0-f0dd-43b0-b42e-6ef35db1959b-0
01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:02.177
And so then, you know, boom, it
goes and then maybe something

7deaa3a0-f0dd-43b0-b42e-6ef35db1959b-1
01:01:02.177 --> 01:01:05.752
happened. Something bad happened
in region four, we realized. Oh,

7deaa3a0-f0dd-43b0-b42e-6ef35db1959b-2
01:01:05.752 --> 01:01:09.164
wait, that that rotation is bad
because of either the way they

7deaa3a0-f0dd-43b0-b42e-6ef35db1959b-3
01:01:09.164 --> 01:01:12.630
set up the secrets or a bug in
their code. And then, like, that

7deaa3a0-f0dd-43b0-b42e-6ef35db1959b-4
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:15.879
would stop. And so, like, you
get that staging that we talk

7deaa3a0-f0dd-43b0-b42e-6ef35db1959b-5
01:01:15.879 --> 01:01:19.454
about, but with secret rotation.
And so then each customer can be

7deaa3a0-f0dd-43b0-b42e-6ef35db1959b-6
01:01:19.454 --> 01:01:22.865
on a different. They can set up
different stages. They can set

7deaa3a0-f0dd-43b0-b42e-6ef35db1959b-7
01:01:22.865 --> 01:01:23.570
up different.

1a521d27-be7c-4bf0-98d8-c6d7341a7c39-0
01:01:25.470 --> 01:01:29.132
You know cadences and such and
rollback policies and all that.

1a521d27-be7c-4bf0-98d8-c6d7341a7c39-1
01:01:29.132 --> 01:01:32.562
And so then what you and I are
working on is gonna operate

1a521d27-be7c-4bf0-98d8-c6d7341a7c39-2
01:01:32.562 --> 01:01:36.225
within that. We're trying to get
it so that that full rotation

1a521d27-be7c-4bf0-98d8-c6d7341a7c39-3
01:01:36.225 --> 01:01:39.888
for Foo in region X happens in
24 hours, which our code really

1a521d27-be7c-4bf0-98d8-c6d7341a7c39-4
01:01:39.888 --> 01:01:41.399
doesn't support right now.

0a8b6ee2-a562-4eec-9a14-5a910ee20a13-0
01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:43.340
So.

64766ebc-d642-4c57-a5ac-1e19948d2bee-0
01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:48.095
So we're both, you know, taking
care of. We're taking care of a

64766ebc-d642-4c57-a5ac-1e19948d2bee-1
01:01:48.095 --> 01:01:51.306
PERF issue, and we're also
simplifying the code while we're

64766ebc-d642-4c57-a5ac-1e19948d2bee-2
01:01:51.306 --> 01:01:54.410
at it and fixing a bunch of
other bugs that our customers

64766ebc-d642-4c57-a5ac-1e19948d2bee-3
01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:57.675
have been complaining about. And
then the, so that's the two

64766ebc-d642-4c57-a5ac-1e19948d2bee-4
01:01:57.675 --> 01:02:00.725
flavors of SDP. There was a
third thing I needed to tell

64766ebc-d642-4c57-a5ac-1e19948d2bee-5
01:02:00.725 --> 01:02:00.939
you.

d3475107-bc13-4198-bb7e-a85562aae0dd-0
01:02:02.370 --> 01:02:06.315
Oh, the bifurcation. So then
like what we mean by non STP

d3475107-bc13-4198-bb7e-a85562aae0dd-1
01:02:06.315 --> 01:02:10.261
secrets is for that cross
regional SDP that we're talking

d3475107-bc13-4198-bb7e-a85562aae0dd-2
01:02:10.261 --> 01:02:10.669
about.

79665a05-779f-4ed0-bc56-133f6dbb8674-0
01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:12.860
UM.

0ee3f29c-d747-49a6-a159-8bb64083637f-0
01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:19.877
The initial implementation is
only for managed chained

0ee3f29c-d747-49a6-a159-8bb64083637f-1
01:02:19.877 --> 01:02:21.000
certificates.

5bfb0f8e-3991-40d3-ae83-49c847502121-0
01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:25.924
Like they they they bubble up to
a PCA or manage self signed

5bfb0f8e-3991-40d3-ae83-49c847502121-1
01:02:25.924 --> 01:02:30.014
certificates. Those are the only
two kinds of secrets that we

5bfb0f8e-3991-40d3-ae83-49c847502121-2
01:02:30.014 --> 01:02:32.390
support for the cross regional
SDP.

4d30ca49-d1e1-4e17-8169-5700f1f20b5d-0
01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:34.810
For.

3d1c3f4e-1454-43b6-9ed4-4bd9ad90b321-0
01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.370
What we're doing?

fceeadfe-3c73-4fa1-b3b6-5310486f48f1-0
01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:39.980
We're supporting all the
secrets.

3aafbac5-ec08-486b-8691-e7adffa74d01-0
01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:43.560
Right. So yeah.

515d3cd1-d4de-4ff9-9317-a86ce323fbc1-0
01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:49.892
OK, yeah, eventually eventually
the cross regional STP will

515d3cd1-d4de-4ff9-9317-a86ce323fbc1-1
01:02:49.892 --> 01:02:53.831
support all secret types, but
the idea is let's get the whole

515d3cd1-d4de-4ff9-9317-a86ce323fbc1-2
01:02:53.831 --> 01:02:57.644
end to end thing working and
then start adding secret types

515d3cd1-d4de-4ff9-9317-a86ce323fbc1-3
01:02:57.644 --> 01:02:58.470
in great. OK.

e6b85667-2687-47e7-96b8-42cf30330d5a-0
01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:00.250
OK.

f2824834-8658-42ac-8fad-4a70d2e62534-0
01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:01.840
Oh.

9262dcb0-a381-40b0-b16c-0b23e3e821d5-0
01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:11.370
And like probably I don't know
if this is the right time to ask

9262dcb0-a381-40b0-b16c-0b23e3e821d5-1
01:03:11.370 --> 01:03:14.603
this question, but so there
were. There were a couple of

9262dcb0-a381-40b0-b16c-0b23e3e821d5-2
01:03:14.603 --> 01:03:17.950
columns in certain tables that
you in the document saying.

cbd8faad-46ff-4b15-bc12-a40e1713f969-0
01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:24.122
Called Etag and payload in
baking distribution package,

cbd8faad-46ff-4b15-bc12-a40e1713f969-1
01:03:24.122 --> 01:03:25.190
right? Yeah.

f9378d87-7e51-4b45-afcf-0b19d1439502-0
01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:30.070
Do you remember what is the
significance? I do now? You also

f9378d87-7e51-4b45-afcf-0b19d1439502-1
01:03:30.070 --> 01:03:33.984
may have noticed that the tables
don't actually match what's in

f9378d87-7e51-4b45-afcf-0b19d1439502-2
01:03:33.984 --> 01:03:37.776
the documents. Yeah, they're
like, yeah, I was trying to find

f9378d87-7e51-4b45-afcf-0b19d1439502-3
01:03:37.776 --> 01:03:41.689
them but. And. And. And that's
just because as I started coding

f9378d87-7e51-4b45-afcf-0b19d1439502-4
01:03:41.689 --> 01:03:44.870
what the code needed and what
was in the documents.

e9f91678-0e78-47c8-97a0-473a1dffad27-0
01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:48.090
You know.

70f106df-0128-4774-99ac-74a277b81e62-0
01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:53.404
And and so you know. So the code
is the source of truth, right?

70f106df-0128-4774-99ac-74a277b81e62-1
01:03:53.404 --> 01:03:56.974
So the document's really good at
capturing the intent, right?

70f106df-0128-4774-99ac-74a277b81e62-2
01:03:56.974 --> 01:03:59.680
There's a distribution state,
blah table, but.

bb560e85-9963-4c16-a6b5-a00f378de5c6-0
01:04:01.810 --> 01:04:05.083
And it just there wasn't much
point in going back and changing

bb560e85-9963-4c16-a6b5-a00f378de5c6-1
01:04:05.083 --> 01:04:08.200
the document because, you know,
we're we're just doing what

bb560e85-9963-4c16-a6b5-a00f378de5c6-2
01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:11.421
works. So, yeah, so that was
what was there. So as far as the

bb560e85-9963-4c16-a6b5-a00f378de5c6-3
01:04:11.421 --> 01:04:13.240
etag and the distribution
payload.

56ab5d98-47b8-4654-976c-b8d25147e75b-0
01:04:14.170 --> 01:04:15.200
So the.

ad5a752b-1cb7-4554-9041-3a159aa990bc-0
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:22.788
So you've got the ACMS agent,
right? That's the, that's the

ad5a752b-1cb7-4554-9041-3a159aa990bc-1
01:04:22.788 --> 01:04:23.300
clients.

6fcac7f6-e94c-4dd3-b399-fcb69372d797-0
01:04:24.730 --> 01:04:28.955
That that, that's the the client
service that runs on everybody

6fcac7f6-e94c-4dd3-b399-fcb69372d797-1
01:04:28.955 --> 01:04:32.849
who needs DSMS secrets. And so
that's the guy who goes out

6fcac7f6-e94c-4dd3-b399-fcb69372d797-2
01:04:32.849 --> 01:04:36.480
polls DSMS periodically gets
down the payload and then

6fcac7f6-e94c-4dd3-b399-fcb69372d797-3
01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:40.309
install search in the store or
in some other secured blob

6fcac7f6-e94c-4dd3-b399-fcb69372d797-4
01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:41.630
storage. Right. And.

6ee4c2e9-2092-4be3-a0ea-04ac252f938a-0
01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:44.130
The UM.

115588ff-40f1-402c-a25d-6b5b0e474056-0
01:04:46.450 --> 01:04:49.320
Interaction with DSMS that's a.

77e6275d-f33d-41b8-a587-0b91a3fd7f5a-0
01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:53.610
It all comes down in one
payload.

c70744c3-8c88-4bd6-91f2-c9bfa2cc88dc-0
01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:58.022
Right. It's not. Oh, get me this
secret because it rotated this.

c70744c3-8c88-4bd6-91f2-c9bfa2cc88dc-1
01:04:58.022 --> 01:05:01.379
No, it's you're gonna get them
all right. But it's also you're

c70744c3-8c88-4bd6-91f2-c9bfa2cc88dc-2
01:05:01.379 --> 01:05:03.990
gonna get the last three
versions of everything.

26cf7dcf-28ed-4adb-bd30-144c941efaeb-0
01:05:05.790 --> 01:05:07.380
And so there's a really.

23d28186-a65b-49ef-ab2d-58e2fc978914-0
01:05:09.010 --> 01:05:14.230
We we need to optimize the
performance of the DSMS server

23d28186-a65b-49ef-ab2d-58e2fc978914-1
01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:14.680
side.

2b81521b-43c6-4427-a17e-cce81f0ba751-0
01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:19.080
Because this is a really compute
intensive, you gotta get.

f2e20303-2fbe-4234-88c6-e7434b13fc92-0
01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:23.589
Maybe there's, you know, 100
secrets, right. And you gotta

f2e20303-2fbe-4234-88c6-e7434b13fc92-1
01:05:23.589 --> 01:05:23.810
get.

bf756c4b-595f-40cb-a56a-b0a4aa9c405f-0
01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:28.420
The last three versions of every
secret and decrypts them all

bf756c4b-595f-40cb-a56a-b0a4aa9c405f-1
01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:32.020
right, and then that needs to go
to everybody. So there's a

bf756c4b-595f-40cb-a56a-b0a4aa9c405f-2
01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:35.800
caching layer that caches those
responses. And the other thing

bf756c4b-595f-40cb-a56a-b0a4aa9c405f-3
01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:38.920
to keep in mind is some of these
services may have.

f842215e-3829-4bfd-8048-e5bf64eb4377-0
01:05:39.790 --> 01:05:45.580
Thousands of nodes hitting DSMS.
So UM, we can't be.

8cacda62-8636-4276-9692-a06d7948b6b4-0
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:49.702
Going straight to the database,
getting all that stuff and

8cacda62-8636-4276-9692-a06d7948b6b4-1
01:05:49.702 --> 01:05:52.534
taking that that hit and the
other thing is uh, and and so

8cacda62-8636-4276-9692-a06d7948b6b4-2
01:05:52.534 --> 01:05:54.550
we've been catching that stuff
in memory.

cff5e94b-3f66-47dd-bf53-278d557367b8-0
01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:56.570
In the old way.

02db2369-7424-4a5c-90e4-6b6d86d29f97-0
01:05:58.070 --> 01:06:02.622
One of the uh performance
optimizations is that we're

02db2369-7424-4a5c-90e4-6b6d86d29f97-1
01:06:02.622 --> 01:06:03.550
gonna also.

b71d7bb1-0a7a-4475-a081-b0972658d813-0
01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:08.617
Write those cat that cached
value to the database so that we

b71d7bb1-0a7a-4475-a081-b0972658d813-1
01:06:08.617 --> 01:06:10.930
only take that compute hit once.

d522c3c3-23de-47b4-8b7d-28cbe695bf84-0
01:06:12.090 --> 01:06:16.144
And so then if a front end gets
rebooted and he goes, oh, I

d522c3c3-23de-47b4-8b7d-28cbe695bf84-1
01:06:16.144 --> 01:06:17.090
don't have my.

7ff9c2e7-0e6d-4b35-acee-559d0dfd3144-0
01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:21.830
By cashed payload for for this
particular service.

b87f7479-d6b6-4c33-8179-668f698e40aa-0
01:06:22.490 --> 01:06:26.098
Fetch it from the database and
then stash it in memory and then

b87f7479-d6b6-4c33-8179-668f698e40aa-1
01:06:26.098 --> 01:06:29.649
go right and so then everybody's
working with the same payload

b87f7479-d6b6-4c33-8179-668f698e40aa-2
01:06:29.649 --> 01:06:33.201
and then the other thing is that
payloads getting updated once

b87f7479-d6b6-4c33-8179-668f698e40aa-3
01:06:33.201 --> 01:06:34.159
every hour by us.

8028b724-6344-4ab1-946c-1f395674b94c-0
01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:36.230
And so.

dff86aad-22d3-4a02-b6b8-8c8107543de3-0
01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.310
That was that was the other
thing was.

8ddd87b4-f156-4d59-bba3-973b6f371f94-0
01:06:40.450 --> 01:06:44.000
The code was super complex
because.

bcfd7bad-3a5d-421c-8ca1-7f6c8708f01e-0
01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:50.652
You might have 10 different
front ends and they've got 10

bcfd7bad-3a5d-421c-8ca1-7f6c8708f01e-1
01:06:50.652 --> 01:06:53.030
different caches and then some
back end worker.

01d6d8b8-8449-4564-8486-63d29afc3a1b-0
01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:55.640
Updates the baking state.

c2924b78-a58d-44b8-8a48-cf2e405d901d-0
01:06:57.130 --> 01:06:58.980
And this guy found out about it.

522dbb14-3b11-4714-bdd4-2dffcea101e8-0
01:07:00.610 --> 01:07:03.142
And starts delivering the new
stuff. But this guy didn't find

522dbb14-3b11-4714-bdd4-2dffcea101e8-1
01:07:03.142 --> 01:07:05.634
out about it yet, and so for
five minutes he's given the old

522dbb14-3b11-4714-bdd4-2dffcea101e8-2
01:07:05.634 --> 01:07:05.880
stuff.

267b9679-4824-4d1b-bf7d-d4d1231ff058-0
01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:11.345
Right. And we're trying to not
have that happen either, UM and

267b9679-4824-4d1b-bf7d-d4d1231ff058-1
01:07:11.345 --> 01:07:11.550
so.

a19f77e8-aed5-407f-afc9-79d9fe1b7137-0
01:07:12.330 --> 01:07:15.697
This distribution packager. He's
gonna do the state advancement,

a19f77e8-aed5-407f-afc9-79d9fe1b7137-1
01:07:15.697 --> 01:07:19.013
but he's also going to go. OK.
What is that? What's the package

a19f77e8-aed5-407f-afc9-79d9fe1b7137-2
01:07:19.013 --> 01:07:22.173
need to look like that? I'm
gonna send downstream. He's also

a19f77e8-aed5-407f-afc9-79d9fe1b7137-3
01:07:22.173 --> 01:07:24.660
gonna write that. That's gonna
be part of that.

00b74d8d-6d1a-4df3-ba33-e2c06c004162-0
01:07:26.110 --> 01:07:30.043
Big stored procedure that
commits the state. It's gonna

00b74d8d-6d1a-4df3-ba33-e2c06c004162-1
01:07:30.043 --> 01:07:34.398
save those blobs there and then
the caching layer which I was

00b74d8d-6d1a-4df3-ba33-e2c06c004162-2
01:07:34.398 --> 01:07:37.840
working on up until about a
month ago. And then.

baab5d7c-e483-41c7-923a-99e1423efdbb-0
01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:42.750
You know the paternity leave for
string of Austin on call and

baab5d7c-e483-41c7-923a-99e1423efdbb-1
01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:43.470
stuff? I was.

d6b447da-6318-489c-a81e-7b86d26f2bc4-0
01:07:44.830 --> 01:07:46.700
Beginning work on that piece of
it.

bfb55095-7cfd-47a6-a271-95e575c9bf9f-0
01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:48.450
So.

e07d9614-7e5e-4f2d-816b-e3640b4c4da5-0
01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:50.860
And and so there's UM.

dd6375dc-2d33-4d7d-bf79-aa8787c7c678-0
01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:55.872
There's the etag which is just
one of the ways that it would

dd6375dc-2d33-4d7d-bf79-aa8787c7c678-1
01:07:55.872 --> 01:08:00.271
identify like cash staleness and
then the actual payload. Those

dd6375dc-2d33-4d7d-bf79-aa8787c7c678-2
01:08:00.271 --> 01:08:04.808
fields are probably gonna evolve
quite a bit as I've learned more

dd6375dc-2d33-4d7d-bf79-aa8787c7c678-3
01:08:04.808 --> 01:08:07.420
about the code. It turns out
there's.

5033e96a-5509-4370-9908-d414afd0e01b-0
01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:13.390
A couple different flavors of E
tag and a couple different.

c395bb67-2708-4f0c-a6f7-e8655b3272d1-0
01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:17.613
UM, things within the payload,
so that's probably gonna evolve

c395bb67-2708-4f0c-a6f7-e8655b3272d1-1
01:08:17.613 --> 01:08:17.950
a lot.

0c4998df-8783-40f3-88a7-c9fbc9fc4e28-0
01:08:20.190 --> 01:08:23.270
Yeah, because I was. I was still
when? When I.

9b84c84c-b15a-453c-8e65-2d1cab18cf18-0
01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:27.775
Press the pause button on this
project. I was still trying to

9b84c84c-b15a-453c-8e65-2d1cab18cf18-1
01:08:27.775 --> 01:08:29.410
understand our existing code.

e9f87042-3ebf-4f3b-863d-065b375ae18b-0
01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:36.149
Yes. Wow. But I, uh, I hope I
took good notes because I've

e9f87042-3ebf-4f3b-863d-065b375ae18b-1
01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:37.740
forgotten it all.

305d1e56-a816-4d88-b9a7-eece74c4ed87-0
01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:41.190
But.

f3157b91-a52a-4c06-8cc7-442aca69625f-0
01:08:41.970 --> 01:08:45.348
If I remember correctly, like
the E tag and payload, these

f3157b91-a52a-4c06-8cc7-442aca69625f-1
01:08:45.348 --> 01:08:48.841
both attributes change every
time the secret rotates, right?

f3157b91-a52a-4c06-8cc7-442aca69625f-2
01:08:48.841 --> 01:08:52.162
So these are these are gonna be
changing once every hour,

f3157b91-a52a-4c06-8cc7-442aca69625f-3
01:08:52.162 --> 01:08:53.880
potentially every hour, right?

6e820fbe-ccd0-49e6-b1d2-6886f06d1114-0
01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:58.811
So, well, I mean, not really
like especially once this whole

6e820fbe-ccd0-49e6-b1d2-6886f06d1114-1
01:08:58.811 --> 01:09:01.640
SDP thing lands, right? So so
think ahead.

f0a321d2-0fd6-4a3f-8413-e10c3e80dd10-0
01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:03.670
A year?

29736ddb-6954-4ddd-8f27-6978b9d65ff1-0
01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:09.161
When the SDP project the the in
region and the SDP thing are

29736ddb-6954-4ddd-8f27-6978b9d65ff1-1
01:09:09.161 --> 01:09:09.840
done. Uh.

54412c0b-fb39-4886-9b4c-5c0a6fce521f-0
01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:14.388
And we're now supporting all
secret types, right? What will

54412c0b-fb39-4886-9b4c-5c0a6fce521f-1
01:09:14.388 --> 01:09:15.010
happen is.

d840b426-043c-444c-8317-c80fb4fea989-0
01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:21.000
Foo Region X go, it'll rotate
everything for Foo.

982b1d62-170b-4e3d-bc31-6b2fc409a338-0
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.690
And.

566d9479-fdbc-48de-845c-071609f22075-0
01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:29.612
And it'll happen probably in a
inside of a pretty quick time

566d9479-fdbc-48de-845c-071609f22075-1
01:09:29.612 --> 01:09:33.525
frame. They say, you know, we've
got all kinds of resilience

566d9479-fdbc-48de-845c-071609f22075-2
01:09:33.525 --> 01:09:37.630
baked into it, but realistically
it's gonna be done in an hour.

3f1a62df-dbbf-40a9-bef4-f5c7d252eb77-0
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.560
And.

741217d3-16d4-4d31-8346-4ede6db843bb-0
01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:44.264
And and and so maybe within that
first hour of the second hour,

741217d3-16d4-4d31-8346-4ede6db843bb-1
01:09:44.264 --> 01:09:47.490
we were gonna have, you know,
like these secrets all baking.

741217d3-16d4-4d31-8346-4ede6db843bb-2
01:09:47.490 --> 01:09:50.769
And so probably 25 hours into
it, they're all gonna be baked.

4d671b84-cd41-4b00-85a8-823307a99789-0
01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:56.347
And then until the next time
that schedule gets kicked off,

4d671b84-cd41-4b00-85a8-823307a99789-1
01:09:56.347 --> 01:09:59.520
it's it's gonna be the same
baked payload.

fa5c07b8-521b-4aae-b517-2ce9b1204192-0
01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:01.190
You know, so.

7740e112-52a1-4391-8e34-8b3374a8c9dd-0
01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:07.296
But for, you know, for 2425
hours. Yeah. You know, as a

7740e112-52a1-4391-8e34-8b3374a8c9dd-1
01:10:07.296 --> 01:10:08.870
secret gets promoted.

dc664fef-90b2-4e78-83fa-eb2199ba4332-0
01:10:09.570 --> 01:10:13.166
Those, those baked and baking
payloads are gonna change a lot

dc664fef-90b2-4e78-83fa-eb2199ba4332-1
01:10:13.166 --> 01:10:13.340
so.

7a256bcc-4f7e-4eb9-97a0-ec8c12f25fb2-0
01:10:16.090 --> 01:10:19.940
But yeah, yeah, I think you you
answer that, but I still didn't

7a256bcc-4f7e-4eb9-97a0-ec8c12f25fb2-1
01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:23.550
get it like yeah, I understand
they they gonna change every

7a256bcc-4f7e-4eb9-97a0-ec8c12f25fb2-2
01:10:23.550 --> 01:10:26.860
time it rotates or or even
advance to any other stage.

155a8584-afa3-40f9-832c-663483157d35-0
01:10:27.930 --> 01:10:32.115
Uh, But what is the
significance? As in, will a CMS

155a8584-afa3-40f9-832c-663483157d35-1
01:10:32.115 --> 01:10:36.783
be involved? Uh, like the
Callie. Uh, yeah. So every time

155a8584-afa3-40f9-832c-663483157d35-2
01:10:36.783 --> 01:10:41.290
a CMS calls, the service is
going to give ACMS the most

155a8584-afa3-40f9-832c-663483157d35-3
01:10:41.290 --> 01:10:45.877
recent baked or baking state
based on the context of the

155a8584-afa3-40f9-832c-663483157d35-4
01:10:45.877 --> 01:10:46.280
call.

b4041b92-33d5-4077-8045-d99e6c2e4b85-0
01:10:47.070 --> 01:10:49.680
UM and right? Yeah.

c6e2986a-ebe7-4e97-95b5-3a4ed0f05047-0
01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:55.270
But uh, but will it also return
these these etags? OK. Uh, that

c6e2986a-ebe7-4e97-95b5-3a4ed0f05047-1
01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:59.921
OK, well so. So the etag is
basically used to match up with

c6e2986a-ebe7-4e97-95b5-3a4ed0f05047-2
01:10:59.921 --> 01:11:04.417
the caller, right? So for
example, if the database has an

c6e2986a-ebe7-4e97-95b5-3a4ed0f05047-3
01:11:04.417 --> 01:11:06.510
E tag of 123 and this blob.

dce8d007-36e5-4332-80ab-3a9eb2bef9dc-0
01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:11.270
And then he CMS calls and says,
hey, I'm calling you.

50e1b347-875f-4578-8bf8-7679f3766e2d-0
01:11:11.970 --> 01:11:16.841
Last E tag you shared with me
was 123. Then we're smart enough

50e1b347-875f-4578-8bf8-7679f3766e2d-1
01:11:16.841 --> 01:11:20.862
to go. Oh well, it is not
changed. Here's your 304.

50e1b347-875f-4578-8bf8-7679f3766e2d-2
01:11:20.862 --> 01:11:24.110
Nothing changed, right. And then
one day.

9c56ae84-f27b-48ca-a138-dbdc9740ecb0-0
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:29.190
Or you maybe six hours later,
ACMS pulls us says hey.

b0a64ce7-b8bd-497f-9222-b3a4cfcfd071-0
01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:31.720
123 is the last thing I saw.

e8f44f02-751e-4ba5-b29d-77135f5bcaf8-0
01:11:33.050 --> 01:11:35.910
And then you know we we check
our etag either in memory or in

e8f44f02-751e-4ba5-b29d-77135f5bcaf8-1
01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:38.725
the database based on you know
what's happened recently. And

e8f44f02-751e-4ba5-b29d-77135f5bcaf8-2
01:11:38.725 --> 01:11:39.510
we're like Oh no.

26c0ca95-602d-436b-a64f-ddb3dcd057d5-0
01:11:40.150 --> 01:11:43.620
We've got our most recent eating
on file is 234.

f3c6dc03-2dd9-476f-ad46-13b2ca0c4bcb-0
01:11:44.330 --> 01:11:46.260
So here half the payload.

62f434f3-4311-48e6-adff-90189c3514b3-0
01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:50.377
And now the next time ACMS calls
us, Hey, 234, and we're gonna.

62f434f3-4311-48e6-adff-90189c3514b3-1
01:11:50.377 --> 01:11:52.290
No, that's the most recent,
right.

0d3b9b1d-b8b5-4f84-a212-cd84a1f7fd19-0
01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:57.535
So. So think of that E tag as a
hash of the paper. Yeah, right.

0d3b9b1d-b8b5-4f84-a212-cd84a1f7fd19-1
01:11:57.535 --> 01:11:58.790
Right, right. Yeah.

60de0eb3-6975-4916-b622-126859ed2652-0
01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:04.670
OK. And and one last question,
uh, so there were there were I

60de0eb3-6975-4916-b622-126859ed2652-1
01:12:04.670 --> 01:12:07.690
think tables or something, was
it tables? Uh.

453e01c0-28e3-45d4-ab5e-0f180fbec272-0
01:12:08.350 --> 01:12:11.211
Like you mentioned in the
document pending deployment,

453e01c0-28e3-45d4-ab5e-0f180fbec272-1
01:12:11.211 --> 01:12:13.240
info info and current deployment
info.

38553097-5fe5-4fa1-83cb-e137dda8f751-0
01:12:13.950 --> 01:12:17.653
Right. Are these meant to be
like the existing? Those are the

38553097-5fe5-4fa1-83cb-e137dda8f751-1
01:12:17.653 --> 01:12:21.118
existing tables. Yeah. Yeah. I
was trying to find that in

38553097-5fe5-4fa1-83cb-e137dda8f751-2
01:12:21.118 --> 01:12:24.464
customer didn't. No, no, no.
Those those are in the SQL

38553097-5fe5-4fa1-83cb-e137dda8f751-3
01:12:24.464 --> 01:12:25.420
database proper.

0d41f1a3-327b-46a4-afdd-ed6b759fb5b2-0
01:12:26.970 --> 01:12:32.380
So so the tables are just to
feed from the, yeah, and.

61bce6f4-490c-4a60-9841-2ee5aa45e47c-0
01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:37.034
And those those, those pending
and deployment if and all that

61bce6f4-490c-4a60-9841-2ee5aa45e47c-1
01:12:37.034 --> 01:12:37.630
that's like.

9a6ea8ea-905f-45f9-8611-b96a128f31e4-0
01:12:38.410 --> 01:12:42.199
That's the old way of doing
things. Yeah. We don't wanna

9a6ea8ea-905f-45f9-8611-b96a128f31e4-1
01:12:42.199 --> 01:12:45.856
touch it. Yeah, entity
frameworks something. OK. Yeah.

9a6ea8ea-905f-45f9-8611-b96a128f31e4-2
01:12:45.856 --> 01:12:47.119
And. And it's just.

c74a775e-bb85-4629-ab71-e383ff7fafa7-0
01:12:49.090 --> 01:12:52.483
The the other reason we're doing
kind of this side by side thing

c74a775e-bb85-4629-ab71-e383ff7fafa7-1
01:12:52.483 --> 01:12:52.640
is.

4caf8d95-1788-45ce-ab53-af68577c74bf-0
01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:57.967
You know what we're doing is
invasive, right? And we want to

4caf8d95-1788-45ce-ab53-af68577c74bf-1
01:12:57.967 --> 01:13:01.572
have a big red button in our
code that we can hit and say no,

4caf8d95-1788-45ce-ab53-af68577c74bf-2
01:13:01.572 --> 01:13:03.840
go back to the old way. We
screwed up.

a525a601-57e5-4db7-94b7-ab3a76267480-0
01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:08.565
Yeah. Yes, yes, that's that's
why we're. That's why we're, you

a525a601-57e5-4db7-94b7-ab3a76267480-1
01:13:08.565 --> 01:13:11.080
know, building a new thing
alongside the old thing.

3dfcd0af-aa79-4cb8-a9cf-766cb8ea2c47-0
01:13:11.770 --> 01:13:12.500
Right, yeah.

a55d47d1-380a-4f4c-8df2-ce8282b6d0d6-0
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:15.680
Yeah.

06b97f3f-03a7-49b0-b137-9cd9c62b936f-0
01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:17.150
Awesome, yeah.

99e6ca20-723f-42a6-a83b-a70f95c9f358-0
01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:21.821
So next I'm gonna work on that
one box thing that we discussed

99e6ca20-723f-42a6-a83b-a70f95c9f358-1
01:13:21.821 --> 01:13:25.919
about. And I also wanted to talk
about one of the other bugs. I I

99e6ca20-723f-42a6-a83b-a70f95c9f358-2
01:13:25.919 --> 01:13:26.539
looked at.

52c85c55-b558-4ec2-b11b-1e5d2f7e946e-0
01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:30.569
Uh, that bug, but you know that
description. I didn't get it

52c85c55-b558-4ec2-b11b-1e5d2f7e946e-1
01:13:30.569 --> 01:13:33.658
very much like, what's exactly
this bug about because you

52c85c55-b558-4ec2-b11b-1e5d2f7e946e-2
01:13:33.658 --> 01:13:36.801
mentioned some hyperlink and it
goes to somewhere. I don't

52c85c55-b558-4ec2-b11b-1e5d2f7e946e-3
01:13:36.801 --> 01:13:39.943
remember. There was like a
fourth bug that you assigned to

52c85c55-b558-4ec2-b11b-1e5d2f7e946e-4
01:13:39.943 --> 01:13:42.980
me. So you want to share your
screen. We can look at it.

fe27646a-47e3-44c3-881e-29b0b99005cc-0
01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:48.770
Yeah, alright. I can just give
you the link of it, OK.

1c8df516-2e07-4930-834c-1555f141e403-0
01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:50.440
Stop.

c2c72d35-fbf8-4d37-b4c5-84662463766e-0
01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.170
One boat something.

51d1a056-5c69-4140-a134-bb08ffa8a499-0
01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:56.510
Excuse me.

5157da4b-1040-417b-b3ea-9911a856ad10-0
01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:06.372
I'm just still getting, you
know, all my books, bookmarks

5157da4b-1040-417b-b3ea-9911a856ad10-1
01:14:06.372 --> 01:14:07.250
and everything.

cf6eef57-0e0f-4cc3-8886-fa7d2401ab45-0
01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:12.210
I lost those on Friday. I'm just
still building up and sucks.

aab60716-eb49-4215-9922-4ff4c1900c7e-0
01:14:12.890 --> 01:14:15.854
But yeah, but I like. I'm glad
that this happened. This didn't

aab60716-eb49-4215-9922-4ff4c1900c7e-1
01:14:15.854 --> 01:14:17.360
happen like two months from now.

978e3ffc-52c9-4d5c-ba8e-8e0a26851276-0
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:20.850
It is still OK.

85623cab-73f2-447f-9986-42c2c0f0a636-0
01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:29.240
Oh.

6ce05692-95d6-47be-9462-0c1d8dd8b452-0
01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:41.261
Do you do you happen to have,
uh, that the the Agile board

6ce05692-95d6-47be-9462-0c1d8dd8b452-1
01:14:41.261 --> 01:14:44.290
open? I may maybe I can find it
here.

b02f8744-e936-4e10-a3ca-af42583a7d0b-0
01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:50.960
DSM, SDP.

caac0b9f-2d4b-4560-b2c1-3ff3a7da72bb-0
01:14:57.450 --> 01:14:58.030
Father.

a564ccad-aea7-4afe-bd4d-72f73bdd727e-0
01:15:00.130 --> 01:15:02.730
Queries. Here we go. I might
have it.

f94fdb28-a6cc-461b-9989-fcbe6052398f-0
01:15:16.450 --> 01:15:17.650
No Dang it.

8a79952a-323a-44e3-ab4b-c2762db96a23-0
01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:19.080
Try it again here.

556b75a6-02f1-4970-95e7-b614bf73bc57-0
01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:30.460
I keep clicking on the wrong
bookmark and it takes me.

1abefbec-c6bd-45cd-978d-4089c546fe80-0
01:15:32.530 --> 01:15:34.430
Getting confused. Here we go.

92245c03-d098-49fd-a291-cbf96dd354d7-0
01:15:40.140 --> 01:15:42.010
So so the there is uh.

41dbc34f-a537-42b6-8304-5f5cdecb9e70-0
01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:44.900
There's one bug.

cf03c240-9781-42bd-8561-f1ffc14ba30d-0
01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:48.390
Other than the three that we
worked on.

46d4bef3-0ffa-4b6e-b244-ece222455ad0-0
01:15:49.090 --> 01:15:52.493
Like there's a fourth. Yeah, I'm
looking right now here. So we've

46d4bef3-0ffa-4b6e-b244-ece222455ad0-1
01:15:52.493 --> 01:15:52.700
got.

4fae1a4d-87af-4e3b-bd81-3f192022751f-0
01:15:54.710 --> 01:15:59.224
Save distribution state is prone
to deadlocking failures. Yeah,

4fae1a4d-87af-4e3b-bd81-3f192022751f-1
01:15:59.224 --> 01:16:01.340
this one is that the one? Yes.

193af1e5-f0cb-440e-bd10-d42c3f7555d5-0
01:16:04.010 --> 01:16:09.524
I think you have a link. Uh.
Yeah, yeah. OK, hold off on this

193af1e5-f0cb-440e-bd10-d42c3f7555d5-1
01:16:09.524 --> 01:16:09.880
one.

870ea83a-895b-4589-9587-a4b37860b522-0
01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:17.068
Yeah, I don't want to get into
it right now. I just wanted to

870ea83a-895b-4589-9587-a4b37860b522-1
01:16:17.068 --> 01:16:17.410
like.

1a4a52f4-bdfc-4fe2-a036-87915037feb7-0
01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:21.980
You to be aware that you know we
will look at it later.

0a84d8c0-c699-4755-983b-1d14c6b3503b-0
01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:25.170
Yeah, what the link was pointing
at.

32187959-ccd6-4ded-ac78-f51617a2d8e5-0
01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:27.190
Is.

17319dab-e997-4be1-812c-814934498347-0
01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:33.700
I'll just show you.

129f72b0-3bd9-4e9b-8f9e-3679d91308c9-0
01:16:40.270 --> 01:16:42.310
Are we sharing? Wait a minute.
What happened here?

9702cfc1-b770-4648-b14b-c8f44be67541-0
01:16:52.970 --> 01:16:53.640
Excuse me.

413ecc27-3fdd-44d3-9f03-a09e521b4be8-0
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:56.730
Got up really early this
morning.

07033ecb-bc65-481e-a5a5-7274112a685c-0
01:17:01.490 --> 01:17:06.405
We've got an area where we have
dashboards for all of our SQL

07033ecb-bc65-481e-a5a5-7274112a685c-1
01:17:06.405 --> 01:17:07.040
queries.

072a8956-1603-4525-bb75-ff7ec76261da-0
01:17:10.270 --> 01:17:15.906
And and it's in the PERF tuning
and then query provider by

072a8956-1603-4525-bb75-ff7ec76261da-1
01:17:15.906 --> 01:17:16.480
query.

a5db989c-4b27-44b3-a406-b4653aceb37e-0
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:19.720
And then.

ad2ea4cf-364c-4161-a261-95a148e976bd-0
01:17:21.330 --> 01:17:24.260
It was saved sequel distribution
state I think.

d8350b30-e06e-4673-bf6d-d21de81adf1b-0
01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:32.670
Save distribution state query
provider and if we look back.

0a477dae-3dfe-4aae-9ae3-b9c2a24ba54e-0
01:17:34.270 --> 01:17:35.120
A day.

7c2c3b94-035a-4ff9-9e59-86a640d7f5be-0
01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:39.870
Across.

6e16375e-e000-4244-a18a-0597e5eff4a9-0
01:17:40.630 --> 01:17:41.920
All instances.

ff2f868c-13d4-4c9a-b07a-7c81d98a33c2-0
01:17:43.870 --> 01:17:44.940
We we're seeing.

c4bf753e-8258-43cb-8895-8552f3b8fad3-0
01:17:45.930 --> 01:17:47.660
Pretty high level of success.

783e145b-a701-4d7a-a21b-0ca60e406a46-0
01:17:48.450 --> 01:17:48.750
Hmm.

bb6bef0e-fdb2-4ff1-857e-97652d96e6dd-0
01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.140
But there's failures.

311ac305-03da-4cc7-80cf-b9e0d01a7a11-0
01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:56.750
You know, 2% failure rate.
That's too much, right?

e5d90c3e-acde-433f-957a-ddaabc12601f-0
01:17:58.640 --> 01:17:59.420
And.

9231e5e9-082a-41a4-a6c8-f9a44579a3b8-0
01:18:01.150 --> 01:18:04.818
The kind of failure that we're
seeing is a storage deadlock

9231e5e9-082a-41a4-a6c8-f9a44579a3b8-1
01:18:04.818 --> 01:18:05.430
exception.

2be03f9a-1712-40ee-aafc-8051e75f97cb-0
01:18:07.130 --> 01:18:11.340
In fact, that's the only failure
that we see in this, OK.

15e1416a-2766-4e21-98a8-565f0077e784-0
01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:12.810
UM.

8db16b27-aaba-4724-a9e5-fd9fe2f7a2ca-0
01:18:14.650 --> 01:18:18.595
And we we definitely do want to
fix this before hitting

8db16b27-aaba-4724-a9e5-fd9fe2f7a2ca-1
01:18:18.595 --> 01:18:22.329
production. I mean we, we do
have some other code in

8db16b27-aaba-4724-a9e5-fd9fe2f7a2ca-2
01:18:22.329 --> 01:18:26.204
production that's hitting
deadlocks with the fact that

8db16b27-aaba-4724-a9e5-fd9fe2f7a2ca-3
01:18:26.204 --> 01:18:27.120
we're seeing.

03a3ba92-cd68-450c-93f3-6d9330d694af-0
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:29.580
This many.

aaf86e72-a6fd-4112-96f8-c1047a243fdd-0
01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:33.900
On a really just in one
environment.

1b65310c-33ef-4226-b66a-4b28204ed772-0
01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:38.941
You know, we're not even hitting
production workloads yet means

1b65310c-33ef-4226-b66a-4b28204ed772-1
01:18:38.941 --> 01:18:39.940
that we've got.

cae7767a-44fc-4381-8dba-470add38383a-0
01:18:40.810 --> 01:18:44.288
A major bug like we've got some
other, you know, code paths

cae7767a-44fc-4381-8dba-470add38383a-1
01:18:44.288 --> 01:18:45.680
where we hit a deadlock.

ca23b0fc-ca6a-41e5-9400-5bfd18162790-0
01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:49.140
Once in a blue moon, but this
is.

66fd999a-8358-408d-b509-355fe87089ae-0
01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:53.290
Yeah, we're almost. Yeah.

90d089c4-128f-4966-a529-be4ca92263ab-0
01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:58.473
We're going to be seeing
hundreds of these a day and in

90d089c4-128f-4966-a529-be4ca92263ab-1
01:18:58.473 --> 01:19:01.600
production and and that's that's
not a good thing.

778232f3-a638-450d-a98f-e0bed8db2887-0
01:19:03.130 --> 01:19:05.670
Are you aware of what a SQL
deadlock is?

b3c7f25d-f0f8-4089-a7b4-5338d882daa3-0
01:19:07.050 --> 01:19:10.110
Uh, like I have some ideas, but
yeah, might be wrong.

a5e0acd1-12dd-4101-9663-20c61551c04c-0
01:19:10.810 --> 01:19:13.100
Also, so basically what it is
is.

1cd2e691-37c2-4dd2-b6e0-3b3c8c899eb8-0
01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:18.170
If SQL transactional database
and so. UM.

355afb77-3c14-4d8f-8f47-2ef9c940ea81-0
01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:24.134
You know for concurrency if if
you got two code paths that are

355afb77-3c14-4d8f-8f47-2ef9c940ea81-1
01:19:24.134 --> 01:19:27.363
hitting the same tables, you
know it takes locks. I'm taking

355afb77-3c14-4d8f-8f47-2ef9c940ea81-2
01:19:27.363 --> 01:19:30.750
a lock on this row or this page
in the table so nobody else can

355afb77-3c14-4d8f-8f47-2ef9c940ea81-3
01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:33.555
write to it until I'm done
writing to it, and then I

355afb77-3c14-4d8f-8f47-2ef9c940ea81-4
01:19:33.555 --> 01:19:35.620
release it and then the other
guy and.

29d0593c-64bf-470a-bbc5-694778f5d19d-0
01:19:36.310 --> 01:19:39.606
So. So somebody has to wait on
me to release my lock and I'm

29d0593c-64bf-470a-bbc5-694778f5d19d-1
01:19:39.606 --> 01:19:42.794
gonna have to wait on somebody
else to release their lock.

29d0593c-64bf-470a-bbc5-694778f5d19d-2
01:19:42.794 --> 01:19:44.200
Right? A deadlock is when.

e581959c-3e91-47ea-b900-ede6b34c506c-0
01:19:45.670 --> 01:19:49.795
A is waiting for B to release a
lock, but's not gonna release

e581959c-3e91-47ea-b900-ede6b34c506c-1
01:19:49.795 --> 01:19:53.987
the lock until a releases his
lock, and so then they get stuck

e581959c-3e91-47ea-b900-ede6b34c506c-2
01:19:53.987 --> 01:19:57.979
and SQL Server detects that and
then picks a winner and the

e581959c-3e91-47ea-b900-ede6b34c506c-3
01:19:57.979 --> 01:20:01.971
other guy just loses his word,
right? So this means if this

e581959c-3e91-47ea-b900-ede6b34c506c-4
01:20:01.971 --> 01:20:05.897
saved distribution state is
hitting a deadlock, this means

e581959c-3e91-47ea-b900-ede6b34c506c-5
01:20:05.897 --> 01:20:06.230
that.

f2582fc3-246c-4752-90de-30dc8539c55f-0
01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:09.100
You know, we're calling that for
one service.

2d1ed7ec-437f-4898-8d94-ca74f6e04755-0
01:20:10.230 --> 01:20:14.345
Saying here's the updated baking
state. So for that one hour

2d1ed7ec-437f-4898-8d94-ca74f6e04755-1
01:20:14.345 --> 01:20:15.020
iteration.

e291ced8-f1d8-4532-967b-8d46ef24de3f-0
01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:17.780
Those results were lost.

b8901442-12c0-493f-bd64-9de9af8b834a-0
01:20:19.830 --> 01:20:23.640
Now the service is made to like
be resilient and you know.

39a0c371-663b-4376-a342-4a878ac234ec-0
01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:27.110
Has a good chance of catching up
next time, but.

779f5061-e010-479e-a26a-760220a4fa9b-0
01:20:28.610 --> 01:20:31.400
It's it's something that we
don't wanna have in our code.

51cef14a-a5ee-44d1-a929-99ce989c6fe9-0
01:20:33.370 --> 01:20:38.152
And it's probably something that
we're inflicting on ourselves

51cef14a-a5ee-44d1-a929-99ce989c6fe9-1
01:20:38.152 --> 01:20:42.934
because who else is calling save
distribution state? It's just

51cef14a-a5ee-44d1-a929-99ce989c6fe9-2
01:20:42.934 --> 01:20:47.489
us. It's just inside the DSMS
distribution packager, right?

51cef14a-a5ee-44d1-a929-99ce989c6fe9-3
01:20:47.489 --> 01:20:52.120
We're deadlocking ourselves in
this code path. OK, yeah, so.

463e68d7-8e7b-40fa-8253-aa69b3420faf-0
01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:56.690
Yeah. Normally when you start
seeing deadlocks.

a426b4f4-5096-45ef-8a40-0b5a09aa4324-0
01:20:57.380 --> 01:21:00.583
You know, in practice is when
like some other feature starts

a426b4f4-5096-45ef-8a40-0b5a09aa4324-1
01:21:00.583 --> 01:21:03.786
messing with your table and
they're querying your table in a

a426b4f4-5096-45ef-8a40-0b5a09aa4324-2
01:21:03.786 --> 01:21:06.150
way that you didn't expect it to
be queried.

afce6541-914b-40df-980d-ee25ebf38855-0
01:21:07.650 --> 01:21:10.340
But here it's just us so.

77923a15-7868-425a-a3f2-de22ca749ce2-0
01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:15.060
Yeah, so, so we definitely do
wanna fix it.

abf895cb-8a02-417d-b403-0ff27afe2626-0
01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:17.440
But.

480f322f-d9dc-4b3c-b499-3b3e738695f3-0
01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:21.120
It's definitely something that.

50b92011-fd6f-4e30-b49e-0a88b3b74aed-0
01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:26.680
It's gonna be really hard to
reproduce it in.

7e124b7b-8faf-49cf-8ee4-c93d12ccafc0-0
01:21:27.630 --> 01:21:28.900
A1 box environment.

6440a4b2-34e1-43ac-8e8e-7b7a47dcafa0-0
01:21:31.060 --> 01:21:31.390
Like.

fa0b7464-3fc2-4589-a763-5934d7493fb6-0
01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:35.000
This was probably because.

8a6feb8d-79b6-4c48-8924-c4a75aa7b2a1-0
01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:39.290
Like we're seeing it here in
Canary because it's running on.

151692a9-379a-468a-a281-81965fe4f53b-0
01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:42.940
10 different machines.

c7717ae9-47f3-47e9-9504-a4133dcd4131-0
01:21:44.130 --> 01:21:44.560
Uh.

66609152-f488-45a4-a0bb-1c751fcfae3c-0
01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:47.020
400 threads.

15c72619-eeda-4cf8-a9aa-ecf3373ce4ad-0
01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:51.387
Of simultaneous execution once
an hour, right? So it's it's

15c72619-eeda-4cf8-a9aa-ecf3373ce4ad-1
01:21:51.387 --> 01:21:54.785
really thrashing in the
database. You're not gonna hit

15c72619-eeda-4cf8-a9aa-ecf3373ce4ad-2
01:21:54.785 --> 01:21:57.690
that kind of throughput on A1
box very easily.

0dc9435f-05d5-4f7b-883c-3cb72d6548c3-0
01:21:58.390 --> 01:21:59.310
So UM.

2ff2e528-f2e9-44e1-a196-04d02fc2e379-0
01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:03.470
Yeah, I did a little write up.

d0d7808d-5871-4693-a1fd-2e960a5c7670-0
01:22:04.230 --> 01:22:08.791
On deadlocks to help them make
more sense, I'll share that with

d0d7808d-5871-4693-a1fd-2e960a5c7670-1
01:22:08.791 --> 01:22:09.860
you, but don't.

09e8e3b4-eba4-4aa3-a4a4-19f600a0f2ff-0
01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:17.830
Don't get too caught up in the
weeds on it yet.

170dc7c9-55b2-47b8-adb0-1051f231a45c-0
01:22:32.150 --> 01:22:32.920
Just a second here.

f44bf2e3-edd3-4433-9b63-478035a04d18-0
01:23:09.690 --> 01:23:10.510
Is this the one?

a57a4446-0e79-4f26-90fd-bf5e9a9d219a-0
01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:12.040
Yeah, that's the one.

88ba119e-a30e-4bcd-bf66-31c938d1c5a1-0
01:23:22.210 --> 01:23:26.060
So I tried to give a really
simple explanation.

15e4a78d-8349-42f8-919a-f0c98f31938e-0
01:23:27.090 --> 01:23:29.260
Of of what's going on in the
database.

92169b56-dfcf-4c35-a32a-d156303a0081-0
01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:35.644
In practice, these things are so
hard to track down, so we

92169b56-dfcf-4c35-a32a-d156303a0081-1
01:23:35.644 --> 01:23:39.030
definitely want to get it done
before it's in production.

5a51675e-594c-4833-ac17-fb18fa64608f-0
01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:41.180
Yeah.

1c486439-6366-43c5-b8d8-c05a907deadc-0
01:23:42.370 --> 01:23:42.700
Yeah.

e89db997-d497-4ea5-9bfd-9df34409f3b2-0
01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:47.330
As you were interested on like
what? Uh, it opened up.

e71ff489-eec1-45ec-aa06-969d551a757f-0
01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:49.460
Geneva, that portal?

ccfc38f7-1145-4113-87d2-017c0409f9d4-0
01:23:51.330 --> 01:23:55.752
Then the the link to that. OK so
so this query provider is safe

ccfc38f7-1145-4113-87d2-017c0409f9d4-1
01:23:55.752 --> 01:23:57.480
distribution state query.

46154d9c-9ba9-484a-9aec-ea8d7ce12c9a-0
01:23:58.990 --> 01:24:03.219
OK, so I'll share it again, it
probably the link just went

46154d9c-9ba9-484a-9aec-ea8d7ce12c9a-1
01:24:03.219 --> 01:24:03.650
stale.

f57d511d-4584-450f-a827-a6332060a287-0
01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:05.610
So.

da5da31c-3d7f-46ef-8c85-3a581c8b999d-0
01:24:07.770 --> 01:24:11.648
I just put it in the chat again
so you can play with that and

da5da31c-3d7f-46ef-8c85-3a581c8b999d-1
01:24:11.648 --> 01:24:15.464
and what what this portal was
about. I think you you told me

da5da31c-3d7f-46ef-8c85-3a581c8b999d-2
01:24:15.464 --> 01:24:16.340
sometime back.

8fe6cc5d-2961-43fa-a7b2-5ba1208b2f7b-0
01:24:17.090 --> 01:24:21.682
So so this is the Geneva portal,
right? And So what I've done is

8fe6cc5d-2961-43fa-a7b2-5ba1208b2f7b-1
01:24:21.682 --> 01:24:22.530
in the code.

bdd0f988-4c22-4360-a667-c76889061f19-0
01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.110
Our our new style of.

332c0578-9580-4a3a-852e-46ef83147200-0
01:24:28.490 --> 01:24:32.518
Calling into the database. We're
using this pattern called. It's

332c0578-9580-4a3a-852e-46ef83147200-1
01:24:32.518 --> 01:24:34.440
gonna be in the storage folder.

d0afc495-e29a-47cf-b138-98c13a5d6f2c-0
01:24:35.890 --> 01:24:37.200
And we're using uh.

8bd58121-f94a-4de5-8ef9-cd686ce54063-0
01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:44.174
This guy called query provider
and so everybody inherits from

8bd58121-f94a-4de5-8ef9-cd686ce54063-1
01:24:44.174 --> 01:24:45.470
query provider.

b6861595-2a43-4546-9cfe-dc62a0cb889e-0
01:24:46.910 --> 01:24:47.560
And.

75e277f3-5f43-4246-95b9-b3849a5d0f95-0
01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:53.281
What you do is you'll you'll
you'll write a concrete

75e277f3-5f43-4246-95b9-b3849a5d0f95-1
01:24:53.281 --> 01:24:56.915
implementation of the query
provider class where you wrap

75e277f3-5f43-4246-95b9-b3849a5d0f95-2
01:24:56.915 --> 01:24:58.670
your call into SQL and then.

78dcdc77-4f91-4094-8861-85370dd42764-0
01:24:59.410 --> 01:25:00.620
When you execute it.

4ea4e99e-886a-4aa3-ac75-6851063427a9-0
01:25:03.110 --> 01:25:06.580
The base class is automatically
gonna gather a bunch of

4ea4e99e-886a-4aa3-ac75-6851063427a9-1
01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:07.200
telemetry.

0ba1d68e-20de-4913-807b-907cb5a4a0a9-0
01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:10.520
And all of that telemetry finds
its way here.

b353be38-553c-449e-875c-6068b9c712c4-0
01:25:11.490 --> 01:25:13.240
And so we see.

46e139a9-7b09-4500-93c6-511529cb9344-0
01:25:15.220 --> 01:25:18.402
A different query provider for
each kind of query that's been

46e139a9-7b09-4500-93c6-511529cb9344-1
01:25:18.402 --> 01:25:19.070
built so far.

965c8228-aaed-4f30-9f53-001ce8bae491-0
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.760
OK.

1728c213-8bb6-4421-a756-2dbe8f533ef2-0
01:25:21.810 --> 01:25:25.770
So there should be like a get
all service ID's.

bb317a43-45bc-4812-9d66-18e31b466363-0
01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:32.319
So here's here's one of the
other ones that gets written.

bb317a43-45bc-4812-9d66-18e31b466363-1
01:25:32.319 --> 01:25:36.715
See this one's all green, right,
right. And then there's get

bb317a43-45bc-4812-9d66-18e31b466363-2
01:25:36.715 --> 01:25:39.310
distribution states query
provider.

bca7a5b4-6f42-408d-a617-6648e686eb17-0
01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:43.650
Yeah.

432fbb97-d8ba-41b2-9fb3-c7e4297c387a-0
01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:47.370
This guy's all green, right?
Totally happy.

949e1a33-9d13-4eac-ad69-58cf6e309322-0
01:25:48.090 --> 01:25:49.140


b5c6a829-1426-4b2d-9a65-db4569768946-0
01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:56.258
The the the failures should
really be few and far between

b5c6a829-1426-4b2d-9a65-db4569768946-1
01:25:56.258 --> 01:26:00.000
and they should only be things
like connectivity exceptions

b5c6a829-1426-4b2d-9a65-db4569768946-2
01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.806
when we see them they should be
transient things. A deadlock

b5c6a829-1426-4b2d-9a65-db4569768946-3
01:26:03.806 --> 01:26:07.673
exception is really really bad
and we should we want to drive

b5c6a829-1426-4b2d-9a65-db4569768946-4
01:26:07.673 --> 01:26:08.359
those to 0.

841ff1f3-4ea0-4c3b-a5bb-b6b6ee451272-0
01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:10.400
Right.

22794c92-b594-4711-9197-094f7d600043-0
01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:19.310
Yeah. So anyways.

41625fb8-71ac-4b96-99fa-99f84472ea8d-0
01:26:21.130 --> 01:26:25.435
Yeah, I I I'll explore more of
this once we have progress with

41625fb8-71ac-4b96-99fa-99f84472ea8d-1
01:26:25.435 --> 01:26:28.580
the one box thing and
everything. Yeah, cool.

ff6fb5c0-0e50-4b8e-a005-0cb6fdcb5354-0
01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:33.250
I wonder do the one boxes show
up in here?

1a2f1ed5-b620-4de7-806b-03ec13db2349-0
01:26:51.990 --> 01:26:52.580
Umm.

bf515778-b7c0-4194-9d42-86c1628c67ff-0
01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:01.400
I just want to see if there's.

bf9af003-96d9-4c8c-b0c3-b2e1420384f0-0
01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:26.310
Yeah, I don't know if any of
these work, but anyways.

2c3fc52d-0029-4fb7-8052-7587b6a913ea-0
01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:30.240
Yeah, I don't know if one box
streams here yet.

cc28af27-8d81-48ae-97f1-9d44a7f61d6c-0
01:27:31.850 --> 01:27:32.500
So.

8a0a4add-2a57-4261-9305-6df72de9ced9-0
01:27:34.230 --> 01:27:34.630
OK.

72d65375-86aa-4fc1-8679-fcde6894153e-0
01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:37.290
Yeah, we'll find it out.

6b457082-607d-4a37-b485-e7645121cdb7-0
01:27:41.130 --> 01:27:41.580
Cool.

e1a3b8b5-6228-490a-88ac-51a81d547290-0
01:27:42.730 --> 01:27:45.845
Yeah, and yeah, that's it. I
think John, thank you so much

e1a3b8b5-6228-490a-88ac-51a81d547290-1
01:27:45.845 --> 01:27:47.800
for your time today. Ohh sure.
Yeah.

bbdf9475-91d0-4418-9e09-bc13dd9bee34-0
01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:53.970
So I'm back up on call
Srinivas's back on Wednesday.

cbd6d2e4-7da1-4e51-a0c1-eeed377d798e-0
01:27:55.530 --> 01:27:56.240
So.

c7808b48-d1eb-46de-aac8-6c4119e06334-0
01:27:57.420 --> 01:27:57.870
Uh.
