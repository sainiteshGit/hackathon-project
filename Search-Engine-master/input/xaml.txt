As a developer your work can already be difficult by requirements you get to produce software. So the process and technology you use need not add complication. I always say that technologists must always find smart and simple ways to achieve complicated endeavors simplify your code simplify your life and Zabol simplify C-Sharp code significantly especially when it comes to building a user interface. Imagine that you need two or more buttons laid out horizontally to create a toolbar in C Sharp. You would write ywis code here on the left. Or do it in the design window which would lead to the same result and Zahm although this would be simplified to the following lines of code on the right when the XML is processed the equivalent properties are set and methods are called to achieve the same goal as the preceding C-Sharp code to the left. There are lots of predefined controls that you can choose from for a common user interface scenarios. Almost all versions of XML support these controls that you see here. For purposes of executing actions we have buttons menus toolbars choosing options you have checkboxes and radio buttons and so forth.
