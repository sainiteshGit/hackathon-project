hi guys this is rahul from simply learnand today we'll be talking about one ofthe fastest growing and second largestcloud computing platform in the marketright now i'm talking about microsoftazure now before we begin let's talkabout what we'll be covering in thisvideo first we'll talk about why youshould be interested in cloud computingwhat exactly is cloud computing what ismicrosoft is your some of its servicesand the uses of azure now let's startwith why you should be interested incloud computing now let's say you havean idea for a revolutionary applicationan idea that ticks both the boxes whenit comes to good applications one it hasgreat user experience and two it will behighly profitable now for it to besuccessful you'll have to release it onthe internet people need to use it theyneed to spread the word and then it'llbecome truly famous however for thatyou're going to need servers storagedevelopers a dedicated network andapplication security to ensure yourapplication works the way it does nowthese are a lot of components and that'swhere the problem lies there are twomajor disadvantages to this approach theinitial setup is very expensive andrisky which means this requires a hugeamount of capital up front to ensurethat it works properly and the downsideis if your application does not becomefamous or it doesn't return as much asyou expect it to you're probably notgoing to get the money back which meansit provides a huge amount of risk andthen on the flip side if it does becomefamous your number of users haveincreased which means that you'll haveto buy more servers and storage systemsto keep up with your demand and thisproblem can be solved with the help ofcloud computing now that you know whyyou should be interested in cloudcomputing let's go into the details ofwhat exactly is cloud computing nowcloud computing is basically a platformthat gives you access to a number ofcomputing resources and this is possiblewith the help of the internet now as auser all you need to do is go to a cloudservice provider through your laptop oryour computer through the internet ofcourse connect to that cloud serviceprovider and then there you go you haveaccess to computing the sourcesnow computing resources may include youknow serverless computing virtualmachines storage and so much more nowlet's dig a little deeper now basicallythese cloud service providers actuallyhave massive data centers now in thesedata centers what you have are hundredsof servers also included are storagesystems and mainly several organizationscritical components so these are verysecure safe locations where a largeamount of data is stored hence the namedata centers now it is to these datacenters that users actually connect tocollect their data or use it so actuallyusers can access any service based ontheir requirement now like i told youthere's a number of services the usercan use for example now if you want anotification every time someone sendsyou a message or perhaps once you get anemail you need a copy of it created nowfor all of this there are services andmost importantly almost every cloudservice provider has this option whereusers only pay for the service that theyuse so there's no charge up front wherethey tell you that you need to pay xamount of money so that you can use ourservices you're only paying for theamount of time that you're using theseservices now cloud computing is used fora wide variety of reasons firstlythere's machine learning and dataanalysis now basically there areservices that analyze your data and tellyou how you can work with this databetter then there's data storage andbackup streaming media content forexample did you know that the shows thatyou watch on netflix actually all ofthem are in the cloud so you'reconnected to the internet and you browsethrough netflix and you get access tothe videos these are possible with thehelp of cloud service providers thiscreating and testing applicationsautomating software delivery which is acomponent in devops and hosting blogsand applications so now what is azurewhat's the big cloud service providerall about so azir is a cloud computingplatform provided by microsoft now it'sbasically an online portal through whichyou can access and manage resources andservices now resources and services arenothing but you know you can store yourdata and you can transform the datausing services that microsoft providesagain all you need is the internet andbeing able to connect to the azureportal then you get access to all of theresources and their services in case youwant to know more about how it'sdifferent from its rival which is aws isuggest you click on the top rightcorner and watch the aws versus yourvideo so that you can clearly tell howboth these cloud service providers aredifferent from each other now here aresome things that you need to know aboutazure it was launched in february 1st2010 which is significantly later thanwhen aws was launched it's free to startand has a pay-per-use model which meanslike i said before you need to pay forthe services you use through azure andone of the most important selling pointsis that eighty percent of fortune 500companies use azure services which meansthat most of the bigger companies of theworld actually recommend using azure andthen azir supports a wide variety ofprogramming languages the c-sharpnode.js java and so much more anothervery important selling point of azure isthe amount of data centers it has acrossthe world now it's important for a cloudservice provider to have many datacenters around the world because itmeans that they can provide theirservices to a wider audience now azurehas 42 which is more than any cloudservice provider has at the moment itexpects to have 12 more in a period oftime which brings its total number ofregions it covers to 54. now let's talkabout azure services now azure serviceshave 18 categories and more than 200services so we clearly can't go throughall of them it has services that covercompute and machine learning integrationmanagement tools identity devops web andso much more you're going to have a hardtime trying to find a domain that azuredoesn't cover and if it doesn't cover itnow you can be certain they're workingon it as we speak so first let's startwith the compute services first virtualmachine with this service what you'regetting to do is to create a virtualmachine of linux or windows operatingsystem it's easily configurable you canadd ram you can decrease ram you can addstorage remove it all of it is possiblein a match of seconds now let's talkabout the second service cloud servicenow with this you can create aapplication within the cloud and all ofthe work after you deploy it deployingthe application that is is taken care ofby azure which includes you knowprovisioning the application loadbalancing ensuring that the applicationis in good health and all of the otherthings are handled by azure next uplet's talk about service fabric now withservice fabric the process of developinga micro service is greatly simplified soyou might be wondering what exactly is amicro service now a micro service isbasically an application that consistsof smaller applications coupled togethernext up functions now with functions youcan create applications in anyprogramming language that you wantanother very important part is that youdon't have to worry about any hardwarecomponents you don't have to worry whatram you require or how much storage yourequire all of that is taken care of byazure all you need is to provide thecode to azure and it will execute it andyou don't have to worry about anythingelse now let's talk about somenetworking services first up we haveazure cdn or the content deliverynetwork now the azure cdn service isbasically for delivering web content tousers now this content is of highbandwidth and can be transferred or canbe delivered to any person across theworld now these are actually a networkof servers that are placed in strategicpositions across the world so that thecustomers can obtain this data as fastas possible next up we have expressroute now with this you can actuallyconnect your on-premise network onto themicrosoft cloud or any of the servicesthat you want through a privateconnection so the only communicationthat happens is between your on-premisenetwork and the service that you wantthen you have virtual network now withvirtual network you can have any of theazure services communicate with eachother in a secure manner in a privatemanner next we have azure dns so azuredns is a hosting service which allowsyou to host their dns or domain namesystem domains in azure so you can hostyour application using azure dns now forthe storage services first up we havedisk storage with this storage you aregiven a cost effective option ofchoosing hdd or solid state drives to goalong with your virtual machines basedon your requirements then you have blobstorage now this is actually optimizedto ensure that they can store massiveamounts of unstructured data which caninclude text data or even binary datanext you have file storage which is amanaged file storage and can beaccessible via the smb protocol or theserver message block protocol andfinally you have queue storage now withqueue storage you can provide durablemessage queuing for an extremely largeworkload and the most important part isthat this can be accessed from anywherein the world now let's talk about howazure can be used firstly forapplication development it could be anyapplication mostly web applications thenyou can test the application see howwell it works you can host theapplication on the internet you cancreate virtual machines like i mentionedbefore with the service you can createthese virtual machines of any size orram that you want you can integrate insync features you can collect and storematrices for example how the data workshow the current data is how you canimprove upon it all of that is possiblewith these services and your virtualhard drives which is an extension of thevirtual machines where these servicesare able to provide you a large amountof storage where data can be stored nowlet's have a look at what we've learnedso far in this video we spoke about whyyou should be interested in cloudcomputing what exactly is cloudcomputing what is azure some of theservices that azure provides and how youcan use azure and with that we'vereached the end of another video i hopeyou guys found this informative
